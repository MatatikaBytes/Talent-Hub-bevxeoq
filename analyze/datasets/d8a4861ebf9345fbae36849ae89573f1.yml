  **Real Assets**

  **Research & Insights**

  October 2019

  **Introduction and background**

  LGIM has asked The Buy-Side Club (TBSC) to deliver a research project in
  order to understand how a selection of competitor asset management firms
  organise their real assets businesses. LGIM has ambitions to further
  develop its real assets capabilities, continue building the brand
  globally, and grow its AUM from third-party institutional investors. The
  ultimate goal is to identify key talent as a potential successor to the
  Head of Real Assets, but LGIM anticipates making some structural changes
  first that could impact the search. This is a highly confidential
  project.

  **Approach**

  TBSC has produced this research and insights piece for **Michelle
  Scrimgeour** (CEO) and **Neil Perry** (Human Resources Director) to look
  specifically at organisational structures and talent. We have targeted a
  select list of comparable insurance-owned asset managers with real
  assets capabilities, as well as market leading, large asset managers
  with established and growing private markets businesses.

  This research is based on conversations with senior sources in the real
  assets space, utilising our extensive network. For each company, our
  findings have been obtained through first-hand research; as far as
  possible, we have verified the information by speaking with additional
  contacts and through public domain research. The real assets sector is
  undergoing a great deal of movement and whilst we are confident that our
  findings reflect the lie of the land this week, the landscape is
  constantly changing.

  Our research has focused on the following companies, as agreed with LGIM
  at the beginning of the project:

  -   [Aberdeen Standard Investments](\l)

  -   [Allianz Global Investors](#AllianzGlobalInvestors)

  -   [Aviva Investors](#AvivaInvestors)

  -   [AXA Investment Managers -- Real
      Assets](#AXAInvestmentManagersRealAssets)

  -   [BlackRock](#BlackRock)

  -   [Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets
      (MIRA)](#MacquarieInfrastructureandRealAssets)

  -   [Schroders](#Schroders2)

  Key questions we have answered in the report are:

  -   How have the target asset management firms grown their real assets
      businesses, both in the UK and globally, and over what period?

  -   Do the real assets businesses operate on a stand-alone basis or are
      they integrated, and how does this work culturally?

  -   What are the structures, reporting lines and coverage of key teams
      globally within the real assets businesses of the named competitor
      companies? And, where possible to ascertain, are these structures
      successful?

  -   Are support resources separate or shared with the rest of the
      business and how is distribution organised?

  -   Key talent -- which individuals could be a natural future successor
      for the current incumbent and what kind of businesses are they
      running now?

  We have also sought and included key market trends, anecdotal
  information on other relevant firms, and notes on systems and
  compensation schemes in our market observations.

  Whilst the talent piece is the ultimate priority and our research does
  include biographies of relevant individuals for future consideration in
  a succession plan, we have not conducted a full mapping nor approached
  any individuals at this stage. We have not provided biographies for all
  real asset unit heads and their number twos, as some are relatively new
  into their current seats, and we felt that others did not have the
  breadth of leadership coverage that the ultimate hire would require.

  **Market observations**

  In broad terms, the investment industry is bifurcating between private
  markets (including real assets) on one side and traditional investments
  on the other. This relates to how institutional investors view their
  portfolios and their in-house teams, to how consultants approach manager
  research, and to how asset managers organise their investment strategies
  and teams.

  Aberdeen Standard Investments, BlackRock, BMO Global Asset
  Management[^1], Schroders and TIAA Global Asset Management[^2] have
  restructured recently to group together their capabilities in real
  assets or private markets. Other firms, such as Allianz Global
  Investors, house real assets within their alternatives division.

  Institutional investors are searching for sources of long-term income,
  inflation protection, and diversification away from equity and bonds.
  They are approaching real assets as an asset allocation "bucket",
  grouping the strategies together because of their common
  characteristics, such as high yields, long holding periods and
  illiquidity. "We see more investors trying to simplify their asset
  allocations to have fewer and broader buckets, to give them more
  flexibility to find homes for things," **Jonathan Rotolo**, Head of
  Private Equity/Real Assets at Barings, told *IPE*.

  This trend, which goes beyond real assets to encompass other illiquid
  investments such as private equity, creates distribution synergies for
  managers, especially where asset owners have the same people overseeing
  all types of private markets investments. Asset managers can also cut
  costs and improve efficiency by sharing resources and systems across
  private market strategies and developing a coordinated approach to
  outsourcing non-core functions. From a management and corporate strategy
  perspective, it may also make sense to split the leadership of private
  and listed investments, given that private markets are in growth mode,
  whereas equities and fixed income are experiencing margin compression.

  Another major benefit of grouping together private markets capabilities
  is that it facilitates the creation of multi-asset alternatives
  strategies:

  -   BlackRock has had an Alternative Solutions Group for six years, led
      by **Pam Chan** globally and by **Louay Mikdashi** in EMEA.

  -   Aberdeen Standard Investments created a Private Markets Solutions
      team in 2018, headed by **Nalaka De Silva**.

  -   Schroders also increased its private assets capabilities within the
      Investment Solutions team in 2018, hiring **Ji-Eun Kim**, Head of
      Private Asset Manager Solutions, and **Chaipetch "Ped"
      Phrompechrut**, Solutions Manager. Ji-Eun has a background in
      private equity and Ped was Head of Private Market Solutions at
      Willis Towers Watson.

  One outlier when looking at "typical" organisational structures is
  private debt, which sits within private markets at some organisations,
  and within fixed income at others. Indeed, some businesses are moving
  their private debt capabilities from one side to the other. Reporting
  lines also depend upon whether the private credit business was grown
  organically or bolted on through acquisitions.

  Organisational structure is often as much about personalities and
  politics as it is about practicalities; for instance, the private credit
  team may fear being dwarfed by real estate. Some firms have witnessed a
  turf war between the leadership of real estate versus private markets.
  At Aberdeen Standard Investments, the private markets head won out, even
  though the real estate business was far larger by AUM.

  Another example is Invesco, which has a Private Markets division born
  out of the amalgamation of their Private Capital (private equity, VC and
  funds-of-funds) and WL Ross (private equity and distressed debt)
  businesses, plus Invesco Real Estate. Invesco hired **Carl Stanton**
  from Wellspring Capital Management in early 2018 as a Managing Partner
  and Head of Private Equity. He had been leading a drive to get the
  different capabilities within the Private Markets division onto one
  single platform for product management, investor relations and marketing
  in order to leverage brand, provide a more cohesive approach, and allow
  them to develop more solutions. Carl left the business in September 2019
  and we understand that **Scott Dennis**, CEO for Invesco Real Estate, is
  now taking more of a lead role in the development of this business, and
  that distressed debt is to sit in fixed income for now.

  **Systems and operating models**

  To date, the majority of asset managers have built out small teams of
  alternatives experts in areas such as operations, product development,
  IT, risk and compliance, with these teams usually reporting into the
  firm's core central functions. Reporting lines may change in the future,
  as firms such as Schroders increasingly ringfence their real assets /
  private markets businesses. One source commented that a key obstacle for
  asset managers broadening their real assets capabilities, is that they
  need to get the plumbing in place before developing new alternatives
  products, from structuring capabilities to specialist legal and
  governance advisory resources.

  M&A is an obvious route to expanding capabilities in private markets,
  but integrating systems and data presents a huge operational challenge.
  For instance, traditional asset managers' data models and teams may not
  be accustomed to handling the non-standard data from illiquid assets.
  Entities that have been acquired may use different, non-compatible
  systems.

  As a case in point, EY worked with an asset manager that had grown its
  capabilities by acquisitions to include private equity, infrastructure,
  real estate and private credit. The operating model was siloed by asset
  class, meaning that the firm was reliant on spreadsheets due to the
  absence of standard platforms, and outsourcing was inconsistent and
  based on legacy arrangements. The asset manager in question eventually
  set up private markets teams with broader cross-asset functions.

  According to market participants, no singular system has been able to
  jointly support all investment desks across both traditional and
  alternative assets. Recognising this, BlackRock acquired eFront in May
  2019, an end-to-end alternative investment management software and
  solutions provider. eFront extended Aladdin's end-to-end processing
  capabilities in alternative asset classes, enabling clients to get an
  enterprise view of their portfolio. The eFront platform will be
  integrated with Aladdin but will also be offered as a standalone
  product. Some investment managers are also looking at Enfusion, whose
  software Integráta is a cloud-based platform incorporating multi-asset
  class solutions for front, middle and back office through a single data
  set.

  Digitization is another trend that may have an impact on structures and
  resources, with McKinsey predicting that advances in this area would
  drive the next wave in innovation and competition among private market
  firms. They cite the four key trends as: redesigning client journeys,
  digitizing deal sourcing and due diligence, using analytics for
  portfolio value creation, as well as outsourcing and automating business
  processes.

  **Distribution**

  The most common distribution model consists of a generalist sales force
  organised by client channel, who usually own the relationships; they are
  supported by dedicated real assets product specialists who are assigned
  to investment teams, but also involved in client work. For any
  traditional asset manager starting to distribute alternatives -- perhaps
  after acquiring a boutique -- it takes considerable time to train and
  upskill the sales force and to establish different touch points with
  institutional investors. As a result, investment teams often take a more
  active part in pitching.

  Where asset owners oversee private markets holistically, it makes sense
  for investment managers to field private markets specialists who can
  cross sell their various illiquid strategies at the same meeting.
  Indeed, several fund managers are creating or growing sales teams
  dedicated to private markets. Schroders created its Alternative Sales
  Unit in 2018 with dual reporting into the Head of Private Markets and
  the Head of Distribution; BlackRock has had a specialist sales team,
  BlackRock Alternative Specialists, for some years now, which was moved
  into the Alternatives Division in 2019.

  Compensation can be a thorny issue as different teams are bedded in.
  Schroders, which has grown its private markets capabilities mostly by
  acquisition, is "struggling" with this aspect according to one of our
  sources, as they are "not paying like specialist sales". Schroders has
  not raised significant assets for private markets strategies through its
  distribution network, our sources say; most of the fundraising has been
  done by the individual boutiques, resulting in the client base being
  concentrated in certain countries such as Switzerland.

  Some real assets businesses, like Brookfield Asset Management, consider
  their focus on infrastructure and real estate to be a huge competitive
  advantage, not least because their distribution team only sells real
  assets. At Brookfield, the private and listed businesses are very
  separate, with their own CEOs, and investment and distribution teams. On
  the private side, senior sales staff specialise in a region and channel
  (wealth or institutional), supported by associates who report directly.
  For example, in London Brookfield has 10 to 12 people in private markets
  sales; on the listed side, the firm has 12 senior sales people globally,
  each with a regional focus and all reporting directly to the CEO of
  public securities. They are supported by a central team of 25 client
  associates (all based in Chicago). Another differentiator for Brookfield
  is being the largest investor in its own funds, stumping up 30-40% of
  the capital from its balance sheet. Individual fund managers are also
  compelled to invest part of their bonuses in their funds, so in both
  senses, Brookfield has skin in the game.

  **Investor demand**

  Just over half of institutional investors (54%) said at the end of 2018
  that they were planning to increase their exposure to real assets during
  2019[^3], while 40% intended to boost their allocations to real estate
  specifically. This trend was even more pronounced among insurers, 66% of
  whom planned to increase allocations to real assets. Within fixed
  income, 72% of insurers aimed to increase their allocations to private
  credit.

  To demonstrate institutional investors' considerable appetite for
  illiquids, over a third (38%) of consultant bfinance's manager selection
  activity during the 12 months to 30.06.19 focused on private markets.
  New real assets, private debt and private equity mandates exceeded
  listed equity (32%), fixed income (19%) and diversifying strategies such
  as hedge funds, liquid alternatives and multi-asset (11%). Real assets
  comprised over half (54%) of bfinance's searches for illiquid investment
  managers, across infrastructure, real estate and niche areas such as
  agriculture and timberland.

  Corporate private debt has been particularly popular over the past five
  years with asset owners creating or boosting allocations. This sector
  represented more than a third of all private market manager searches
  handled by bfinance in the 12 months to 30.06.18, and a quarter of
  searches over the subsequent year. The consultancy saw a substantial
  rise in private equity activity over the past year, but that may be as a
  result of increased internal staffing levels.

  Global institutional investors' average target allocation to real estate
  increased to 10.4% in 2018 from 10.1% in 2017, according to a survey by
  Hodes Weill & Associates. This research found that investors were moving
  away from core to value-added and opportunistic strategies, particularly
  in North America due to concerns about valuations. In other regions,
  appetite for alpha-seeking strategies increased but demand for core
  investments had "hardly waned".

  McKinsey's observations differed however, noting a preference for core
  and core-plus funds during 2018 as institutional investors sought
  substitutes for fixed income. Fund managers to whom we have spoken also
  talked about demand from institutional investors for core funds and said
  alternative managers were rolling out lower octane strategies as a
  result. Large institutional investors want more control over their real
  estate holdings, McKinsey noted. They are gravitating towards vehicles
  where they have more liquidity and more discretion and/or growing their
  portfolios of direct investments.

  Consultants have been boosting their resources to cater to their
  clients' increasing appetite for illiquid investments and diversified
  sources of income. As a case in point, Aon acquired real estate
  specialist The Townsend Group in January 2018; Mercer has also expanded
  its capabilities through acquisitions[^4].

  **Fundraising**

  Closed-end private markets vehicles raised \$778 billion globally in
  2018; this was an 11% decline compared to the 2017 peak, although 2018
  was nonetheless the third strongest year on record (behind 2016 and
  2017). Fundraising in private markets has grown by 8% annually since
  2013, while private debt, natural resources and infrastructure have
  grown disproportionately faster, according to McKinsey.

  Real asset classes saw increased inflows in 2018, with infrastructure
  fundraising in Europe up 59% in 2018 compared to 2017, and up 22% in
  North America. Fundraising for natural resources grew 16% in Europe and
  8% in North America, offsetting declines in closed-end real estate
  funds.

  In 2018, 139 private debt funds closed, raising \$109 billion -- the
  second-largest fundraising on record (down 15% from the 2017 peak of
  \$127 billion[^5].) Private debt funds have returned about 10% annually
  since 2018, strengthening the investment case.

  Inflows are being increasingly consolidated into the largest real assets
  funds from the biggest managers. Larger platforms can be more cost
  efficient and institutional investors draw comfort from investing with
  larger, well-established firms that they believe can better weather any
  market downturns or crises.

  Mega funds (i.e. over \$5 billion) accounted for 29% of all fundraising
  in 2018; 19 funds of \$5 to \$10 billion were raised, absorbing 20% of
  all private market fundraising, while 9% of inflows ploughed into funds
  over \$10 billion, McKinsey stated.

  Capital raising has outpaced investment volume. As dry powder mounts up,
  the single biggest issue facing investors this year is how to deploy
  capital as the cycle matures, amidst strong competition for investments.
  Against this backdrop, BlackRock advised investors to place greater
  focus upon strategies that mitigate risk, and to build a resilient
  portfolio, integrating ESG considerations[^6].

  **ESG integration**

  Sustainability has become "a prerequisite consideration in the
  construction of a resilient \[real assets\] portfolio and necessary to
  maintain high-quality and long-term value," according to BlackRock.
  Managers and investors are both raising their expectations, with a
  growing population of managers self-reporting into the GRESB global ESG
  benchmark for real assets. Aberdeen Standard Investments has a small ESG
  team embedded in its Real Estate business headed by **Dan Grandage**,
  and Aviva Investors hired **Ed Dixon** in September 2019 as Head of ESG
  for Real Assets, a newly-created role.

  **Private equity entrants**

  Private equity managers such as BC Partners, Blackstone, Carlyle Group,
  KKR and TPG are broadening their capabilities across the private markets
  spectrum, building upon their expertise in capital raising,
  relationships with investors, strong brands, nimble cultures and
  aggressive ambition.

  One management committee member of a real assets division said he sees
  these private equity firms as a far greater competitive threat than
  managers such as BlackRock or M&G because of their level of ambition.
  They are not held back by legacy businesses, they are nimble and
  unafraid to take on a new challenge. He predicted that in five years'
  time, private equity players such as KKR will be making bigger waves in
  real assets than M&G, despite the latter's ambition to expand its
  European real estate capabilities.

  **Talent considerations**

  This document is positioned as a piece of competitor intelligence
  research, rather than a map or shortlist. We have highlighted relevant
  talent at each of the target firms and would welcome the opportunity to
  follow up with a focused succession plan, once a defined hiring brief
  has been agreed.

  We have not provided biographies for some potentially obvious candidates
  for a succession plan as they have only recently been appointed into
  their roles. These include **Georg Wunderlin**, Global Head of Private
  Assets at Schroders, and the individual he replaced, **Alan Cauberghs**,
  who recently joined Generali Investments as Head of Private Assets.
  Similarly, the former Deputy Head of Private Markets at Aberdeen
  Standard Investments (ASI), **Steven Murray**, has recently been hired
  by Royal London as Corporate Development Director; his former colleague
  **Andrew McCaffery**, who was Head of Alternatives at ASI, has joined
  Fidelity International as Global CIO, Alternatives & Solutions and
  Deputy Global Head of Asset Management.

  Certain other potential candidates at number two level (reporting
  directly into heads of private markets / real assets) have not been
  included in the key talent sections because we felt they lack either the
  global coverage, with experience of expanding a business
  internationally, or because they have a very narrow view by investment
  strategy (for example having only led a private equity or infrastructure
  business).

  Apart from the organisations on which we have focused for this report,
  it would also make sense to consider talent within firms that have
  historically specialised in private equity, private credit,
  infrastructure and/or real estate, but which are now broadening out
  their capabilities. Bringing somebody across from an alternatives shop
  is not without its challenges in terms of culture and compensation,
  however. Furthermore, as alternatives houses encroach upon the
  institutional investor market, competition for talent is intensifying as
  these firms are seeking people with the same profile as mainstream asset
  managers. In this vein, two individuals who have been recommended to us
  during the course of our research are **David Jeffrey**, Partner & Head
  of Europe at StepStone Global, and **David Forbes-Nixon**, Chairman and
  CEO at Alcentra.

  **Compensation **

  Compensation for private markets professionals differs from firm to
  firm, but often includes an element of carried interest, especially in
  pure play alternatives firms like Brookfield and Blackstone who prefer
  their investment teams to have skin in the game.

  Alternatives boutiques are mainly concerned with attracting and
  retaining the best talent, so the trend is towards increasing
  compensation. Large multi-asset firms can sometimes struggle to attract
  people from alternatives shops if they are unable meet their salary
  expectations or compensate for the carried equity from which the
  individuals would be walking away. Firms that have grown their real
  assets or private markets units by acquisition have often tailored their
  compensation schemes for investment staff in individual boutiques, with
  traditional investment desks on more typical base plus discretionary
  bonus schemes.

  Differing compensation schemes within firms does, however, cause
  internal tension and this is one area being reviewed by some of the
  companies we researched. Nonetheless, trying to impose a "one size fits
  all" compensation scheme across liquid and illiquid desks can also
  create challenges, as firms like BlackRock have discovered.



  Aberdeen Standard Investments, which has just launched its private
  markets franchise, is currently going through a compensation
  discussion internally. Historically, there has been carry for most
  products, with everyone involved (including specialist sales who get 10%
  of the carry) required to invest in their funds, although this was not
  uniform and is currently being standardised.



  At AllianzGI, compensation varies by team. Some staff are incentivised
  with carry-based structures; this is not senior management's preferred
  approach, but it may be necessary to attract people. Portfolio managers
  for liquid alternatives tend to be better paid than their counterparts
  in the private markets business. 



  Most of the investment teams at AXA IM have a traditional compensation
  package, so fixed salaries plus variable remuneration (part subject to
  some deferred payment, depending on amount and seniority). Key people
  also have carry programmes in place, mainly in parts of the business
  that have been acquired. 



  At MIRA there are various elements to compensation, but sources indicate
  that the formula is the same across different investment teams. The
  "Macquarie approach" is to have some of the variable element (which they
  call "profit share", not bonus) linked to the performance of strategies,
  with the rest discretionary.

  **Recent appointments**

  Multi-asset managers and boutiques have been adding to their real assets
  capabilities over the past year, as is symptomatic of a growing sector:

  **Apollo Global Management** in New York announced on 26 September 2019
  that **Dylan Foo** would be joining the firm as a Senior Partner and
  Co-Lead of its Infrastructure business. He was Partner and Head of
  Americas Infrastructure Equity at AMP Capital. Dylan will work with
  Senior Partner **Geoff Strong**, who was promoted to Co-Lead of
  Infrastructure and Co-Lead of Natural Resources in order to develop
  synergies between Apollo's infrastructure and natural resources
  investment activities. Senior Partner **Olivia Wassenaar** was named as
  the other Co-Lead for Natural Resources. Meanwhile, Senior Partners

  Hines promoted **Alex Knapp** and **Lee Timmins** to CIOs of Europe and
  Asia, respectively. The Houston-based firm also announced a new
  investment management platform, co-led by Global CIO David Steinbach and
  CEO of Capital Markets Chris Hughes. Furthermore, Hines has expanded its
  global investment committee and established a new investment risk team
  and a global investment strategy team.

  In September 2019 **Intermediate Capital Group** hired **Alan Jones**,
  the former Head of Private Equity at Morgan Stanley, to build a private

  **Aberdeen Standard Investments**

  **Background**

  Aberdeen Standard Investments (ASI) has a long track record of managing
  private markets strategies, having built the business organically and
  through acquisition. It manages over €67 billion in private market
  assets, with 400 dedicated private markets professionals in 21 offices.

  In 2017, following the Standard Life Investments (SLI) and Aberdeen
  Asset Management merger, **David Paine** and **Pertti Vanhanen** became
  Co-Heads of Real Estate. They previously led the two firms' respective
  real estate businesses. **Peter McKellar**, who was Head of Private
  Markets Solutions at SLI and Head of SL Capital (the private equity and
  infrastructure arm of Standard Life Investments, co-run with **Roger
  Pim**), was named Global Head of Private and Infrastructure Equity for
  the merged business.

  In September 2019, ASI announced the launch of a Private Markets
  franchise, bringing infrastructure, natural resources, private equity,
  private credit and real estate under one umbrella for the first time.
  Peter McKellar was appointed Global Head of Private Markets, with **Neil
  Slater** as his deputy. Neil was also named Head of Real Estate,
  replacing Pertti and David, who are leaving the business. Neil has a
  real estate structuring background and was most recently CEO of ASI
  Japan; he is relocating to the UK for his new role.

  Peter said the reorganisation would enable ASI to deliver better
  solutions to clients. "Structural change and evolving market
  environments, with investors increasingly allocating to non-public
  market assets, makes it even more important to have a fully integrated
  approach to private markets," he explained[^7].

  The new structure means that all investment teams from the historic real
  estate and private markets businesses now roll up to Peter. According to
  internal sources, one key goal of the restructure is to get all of the
  investment desks to work in a more cohesive manner; they previously
  worked on a very siloed basis, even those that reported to Peter. ASI is
  also looking to better leverage the real estate business' extensive
  research capabilities.

  The drive towards combining private markets capabilities has been active
  for some time. Even before the merger with SLI, Aberdeen's CEO Martin
  Gilbert gave Pertti Vanhanen a mandate to bring together the firm's real
  assets capabilities in infrastructure, direct real estate, multi-manager
  real estate and natural resources such as timber. Then after the merger,
  a leadership group worked with an external consultant to decide upon the
  right structure going forwards, and the firm started to bring together
  its real assets operations. Since the Spring of 2019, ASI has integrated
  deal origination between infrastructure and real estate.

  ASI's decision to promote the Head of Private and Infrastructure Equity
  over the real estate chiefs is symptomatic of a power struggle happening
  at many firms. One senior internal source said that "Peter has been
  'land-grabbing' for real estate for years and has recently won, hence
  the restructure". This has happened despite real estate being the larger
  business by far, comprising circa two-thirds of the firm's private
  markets capabilities by AUM.

  **Steven (Steve) Murray**, who was Deputy Head of Private Markets
  reporting to Peter, resigned from the business a few months ago. He is
  soon to take up the newly-created position of Corporate Development
  Director at Royal London, focusing on M&A activity, group strategy and
  operational efficiency[^8].

  **Shared services resources and systems**

  Peter McKellar's universe solely comprises investment desks at present.
  As part of the restructure, ASI is looking at shared services including
  Operations, IT, Product and Distribution, and how these functions
  support the Private Markets business. It is too early to ascertain what
  changes will be made and given the many moving parts, we are not
  currently in a position to draw an accurate organisation chart for the
  business.

  To date, ASI has had centralised Technology, Finance and Operations
  departments, but with some dedicated specialists in these teams focusing
  on real estate and private markets. By way of example: **Trevor
  McDonald** is Head of Real Estate Operations (EMEA); the same goes for
  Legal with about six of the 30 to 40 strong department assigned to
  investment teams that now sit in the Private Markets franchise.

  ASI is increasingly viewing its business in two parts: public and
  private markets. We understand that they are considering splitting
  Operations and Infrastructure in two, with public and private markets
  each having their own defined support. The rationale would be to enable
  the functions to support the investment desks in a more joined up way
  and to allow for better business outcomes for clients. However, there
  are some grey areas especially around alternative credit.

  ASI is also looking at platform development to see what potential there
  is for integrating the various systems and tools used across different
  private markets desks (including eVest Technology), to allow for a more
  streamlined approach to reporting, portfolio analysis and other tasks.

  **Distribution**

  The different investment desks in the Private Markets business have
  relied predominantly on regional business development generalists, with
  an overlay of specialist distribution in some instances. As a result of
  the limited specialist sales resources, most of the asset raising for
  Private Markets to date has been done by the investment teams themselves
  and senior product strategy leads like Roger Pim, Global Head of Private
  Markets Product Strategy and Solutions.

  There are pockets of people in Distribution under **Campbell Fleming**
  with specialist roles, including **Sam Clothier**, Private Market Sales
  for Asia-Pac ex Japan, **Alan Coffey**, Head of Private Markets
  Fundraising, Europe and **Ben Steele**, Private Markets Sales, Europe.
  They work for **Stewart Hay**, Global Head of Private Markets Client
  Strategies, whose team is charged with creating proprietary
  relationships with existing and potential clients, and working in
  collaboration with generalist sales colleagues. One source commented
  that collaboration has been challenging, especially as distribution
  staff involved in private markets sales have received 10% of the carry
  to date, which has caused some internal frustration. However, there is a
  wider compensation discussion happening across the business so this may
  change.

  Real Estate has historically had a team of six property specialists
  globally in Distribution, reporting locally into their distribution
  channel heads and with a dotted line into **Robert Matthews**, Head of
  Real Estate Investment Specialists. They include **Luke Powell**,
  Investment Director - Real Estate, and **Mike Dinsdale**, who was the UK
  specialist Property Client Director until he left in March 2019.

  Sources indicate that ASI is moving towards a more specialist investor
  relations and sales model to better align themselves with their target
  client base, and that the firm is looking to hire more technical
  distribution professionals who can sell across the different private
  market strategies. It remains unclear whether these individuals will
  report into Distribution or Private Markets going forwards.

  **Product & Client Solutions**

  In April 2019, ASI formed a new Client Solutions Group and promoted
  **Robert McKillop** to Global Head of Product & Client Solutions. Robert
  retained his previous responsibilities for UK proposition, UK digital
  advice, product development and management, and product strategy. **Ian
  MacDonald** and his team were moved from Investment to work for Robert,
  and Ian was given the title Global Head of Strategic Client Solutions.
  Ian's team has responsibility for engaging with institutional and wealth
  clients on matters that impact their whole portfolio. The group brought
  together the previous strategic client solutions team with the
  outcome-based product strategy and solutions teams.

  **Jonathan Price** had been Global Head of Investment Specialists,
  reporting into Distribution, until his role was made redundant at the
  start of 2019. Some of the private market asset class specialists who
  previously reported to Jonathan include **Barry Fricke**, now Global
  Head of Private Credit, Product Strategy & Solutions, and **Neil
  Meikle**, Global Head of Real Estate Product Strategy. Whilst embedded
  in their relevant investment teams, these individuals now report into
  the Client Solutions Group. Robert Matthews, Head of Real Estate
  Investment Specialists, used to work for David Paine rather than
  Jonathan. One source has informed us that Robert Matthews now works for
  Robert McKillop.

  **Roger Pim**, Global Head of Private Markets Product Strategy and
  Solutions, who was formerly Deputy Head of SL Capital (Private Equity,
  Infrastructure and Private Credit) has a small senior product team. This
  includes an actuary called **Ross Hayter**, who serves as Investment
  Director Private Markets, Product Strategy and Solutions, and **Erika
  Gucfa**, Investment Director, Private Markets, Product Strategy and
  Solutions, who is based in the US.

  The private markets product strategy professionals are responsible for
  product strategy, new product innovation and commercialisation,
  representing the private market capabilities of the firm with clients,
  and developing customised investment solutions for clients globally. The
  general consensus from our internal contacts is that reporting lines for
  these individuals is likely to change as the Private Markets restructure
  continues.

  **Real Estate**

  ASI has over 50 years' experience investing in real estate and £39
  billion AUM. The business has invested in 1,600+ properties in 20
  countries, managed by local real estate teams in 15 offices, with over
  250 professionals across real estate investment, development,
  transaction and portfolio management. As well as managing direct real
  estate assets, ASI invests indirectly using listed and non-listed funds,
  multi-manager strategies and real estate debt.

  David Paine and Pertti Vanhanen had been seeking to expand the real
  estate business globally, with David having responsibility for Asia. He
  spearheaded the February 2019 acquisition of Orion Partners, which grew
  the firm's footprint with on-the-ground direct real estate teams in
  Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.

  "The challenge that we have been set with the real estate business is to
  globalize," David told *IPE Real Assets*[^9] at the time of the merger.
  "We are the only asset class to not achieve a truly global footprint --
  in the direct space. We have indirect multi-manager business and listed
  business, but from the direct perspective that is our challenge."

  The new leadership structure for real estate under Neil Slater is yet to
  be confirmed. International expansion is likely to be one of Neil's key
  priorities. The business still does not have a direct real estate
  platform in the US.

  **Private Markets business (pre-September 2019)**

  Peter McKellar was appointed Global Head of Private and Infrastructure
  Equity after the merger, overseeing private equity, infrastructure, real
  assets, strategic credit and private markets solutions, totalling £17-18
  billion of AUM. Except for the private equity and infrastructure teams
  who came over from SL Capital, there has been little synergy between the
  other asset classes, even though the business heads all reported to
  Peter, according to internal sources.

  Before the recent restructuring was announced, the teams reporting
  directly into Peter included the following:

  **[Private Equity]{.ul}**

  ASI's private equity business has £13 billion AUM managed by c. 60
  private equity professionals based in Edinburgh, London, Boston,
  Stamford and Hong Kong. It is led by **Graham McDonald**, Head of Global
  Private Equity, with **Merrick McKay** as Head of Europe - Private
  Equity. Graham was Head of Private Equity for Aberdeen Asset
  Management's Alternatives Division, and Merrick was Head of
  Co-Investments at SL Capital Partners.

  SL Capital was the private equity and infrastructure arm of SLI. Since
  its creation in 1998, the business raised in excess of €10 billion for a
  wide range of vehicles. It had a partial spinout in 2007, operating as a
  semi-autonomous business until 2017 when it was rolled back into SLI as
  several key members of the leadership team approached retirement.

  **[Infrastructure]{.ul}**

  Standard Life's infrastructure business was established by SL Capital in
  2009. Infrastructure is co-led by **Dominic Helmsley**, Head of Economic
  Infrastructure (who came from Standard Life) and **Gershon Cohen**, Head
  of Concession Infrastructure (from Aberdeen Asset Management). The two
  work well together, according to sources. Between them, they have about
  50 staff in London, Edinburgh, Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, Sydney and
  Bogota. They have c. £4 billion AUM and invest in significant
  infrastructure projects, such as roads, rail, bridges, power and water
  facilities.

  **[Real Assets / Natural Resources]{.ul}**

  Real Assets is a small unit led by **Jim Gasperoni**; he joined the
  business in 2015 when Aberdeen Asset Management acquired FLAG Capital
  Management LLC, a manager of private equity and real asset solutions
  with offices in Stamford, Boston and Hong Kong. Jim is Boston-based with
  six direct reports. The team invests in natural resources including
  forestry, agriculture and energy production with capabilities across
  primaries, secondaries and co-investments and about £659 million AUM.

  **[Private Markets Solutions]{.ul}**

  In February 2018, ASI launched its first comprehensive private markets
  solution for investors, the Global Private Markets Fund (GPMF), which
  provides a "one stop shop" for clients wanting exposure to various real
  assets, investing in a diversified global mix of private equity,
  infrastructure, real estate and private credit. The fund is managed by a
  10-strong team based in Edinburgh, London, Boston and Singapore, headed
  by **Nalaka De Silva** in Edinburgh. Nalaka used to work for Jonathan
  Price prior to being moved into his current role in 2018, with the
  mandate to build the portfolio management, operational governance and
  reporting for the new private markets fund.

  **[Private Credit]{.ul}**

  ASI has c. £6 billion AUM in Private Credit, which includes a small
  Strategic Credit capability led by **Ingrid Neitsch**. Ingrid has been
  responsible for managing the Private Credit Strategies portfolios since
  2014, when she joined SL Capital as part of Standard Life Investment's
  takeover of Ignis Asset Management.

  ASI acquired fund financing boutique Hark Capital in 2018. **Doug
  Cruikshank** continues to lead this franchise, which provides
  non-dilutive loans to the portfolio companies of sponsors in situations
  that would typically require equity. Doug and Ingrid between them had a
  team of about 10 (as of November 2018) based in New York (where Doug is
  located), London and Edinburgh.

  **[Asset Management Minority Investments / Bonaccord Capital Partners
  (BCP)]{.ul}**

  This unit is relatively small and led by **Ajay Chitkara** in New York.
  Aberdeen formed Bonaccord Capital in 2017, bringing on Ajay, who was
  Senior Managing Director within the Alternatives Investment Division,
  and a group of executives from Guggenheim Partners, to lead the effort.
  Ajay and his team source, evaluate and execute structured investments in
  private-equity firms and other alternatives investors. *Private Equity
  News* reported at the time of its launch that Bonaccord aims to buy
  stakes of up to 25% in 10 to 15 private markets managers, and that its
  fund would be a permanent capital vehicle without a fixed lifespan. In
  February 2019 it was reported that the team had raised a quarter of
  their \$1 billion initial target.

  []{#AllianzGlobalInvestors .anchor}**Allianz Global Investors**

  **Background**

  The Alternatives business was established in December 2014 as the fourth
  pillar of Allianz Global Investors (AllianzGI), alongside Equities,
  Fixed Income and Multi-Asset. This new platform brought together
  capabilities in Equity Long/Short, Merger Arbitrage, Options Trading,
  Commodities, Volatility, Global Macro, Absolute Return Bonds, Private
  Debt, Infrastructure Debt, and Infrastructure Equity. In terms of AUM,
  before the Alternatives pillar was established AllianzGI managed €5.4
  billion in alternatives (as at October 2014); by June 2019, Alternatives
  had €77 billion AUM and held 14% of AllianzGI's overall AUM.
  Alternatives houses over 90 investment professionals and has two
  component parts ̶ Liquid Alternatives, then Private Markets and Real
  Assets.

  When the Alternatives division was created, **Spencer Rhodes** was named
  Alternative Investments Global Business Manager, reporting to CEO
  **Andreas Utermann**. Spencer had been instrumental in developing the
  alternatives product offering since joining AllianzGI in July 2013 from
  Tradewinds Investment Management.

  Over the next two years, Spencer oversaw the Alternatives division's
  growth from €7.9 billion in December 2014 to €15.7 billion by March
  2016, doubling its assets. He hired Alternative Investment Strategist
  **Christopher Clarke**[^10] in October 2015 and one other professional.
  Together, they formulated the business strategy and led the Alternatives
  division's growth, both organically and through acquisitions. The trio
  also acted as client-facing product specialists, meeting over 100
  clients per year, and trained AllianzGI's institutional and retail sales
  teams across the globe on their alternative investment products and
  capabilities.

  **Deborah Zurkow**, who joined AllianzGI in 2012 to establish its
  infrastructure debt platform, was promoted to Head of Alternatives on 1
  June 2016, a newly-created role. She joined the Global Executive
  Committee upon her promotion, marking the first time the Alternatives
  business was represented on this committee. Spencer reported into
  Deborah, and was responsible for product development until his departure
  in 2017[^11].

  **Private Markets and Real Assets**

  AllianzGI's Private Markets and Real Assets group includes:

  -   Infrastructure Debt

  -   Infrastructure Equity (investing in renewable energy assets)

  -   European Private Credit

  -   European Corporate Loans

  -   US Private Placement Debt

  -   US Private Credit Solutions

  The Alternatives division does not have a real estate business, leading
  one internal source to speculate that it might look to acquire real
  estate capabilities. Allianz Real Estate[^12] -- the captive real estate
  investment manager for the Allianz Group -- is a separate entity,
  although there is an ongoing debate internally about whether it should
  start servicing third-party clients.

  height="5.902777777777778in"} **Organisational structure: Alternatives
  (as at October 2019)**

  **Distribution**

  At AllianzGI, sales staff are segmented by region and client channel
  rather than asset class or strategy. For instance, in 2017 the business
  hired **Leon Douch** as Head of Insurance (UK), and **Jason Allan** as
  Director, Institutional Business Development; both report to **Irshaad
  Ahmad**, Head of Institutional Europe. (Leon was previously Deputy CEO
  (UK) and Head of Insurance Sales at Amundi; Jason was UK Head of Pension
  Funds at State Street.) Sales staff sell across all asset classes
  including alternatives. There has been particular appetite for long-term
  debt and infrastructure from insurance clients in EMEA who are looking
  to match their liabilities.

  Distribution teams are supported by product specialists. This group
  previously sat in investment, functionally reporting to **Arne
  Toelsner**, who was Global Head of Product Specialists but became Head
  of Institutional Germany, Austria & Switzerland in 2017. The
  Alternatives division now has its own team of product specialists under
  **Hans-Jürgen Weidenbacher**, Global Head of Product Specialists,
  Alternatives, who reports into Deborah Zurkow. He was originally hired
  in 2013 as Business Manager for the Infrastructure Debt platform.

  Hans-Jürgen's team is dedicated to alternatives, but is not attached to
  individual strategies, with the exception of a handful of
  strategy-specific product specialists in the private capital team (due
  to a legacy acquisition). We understand that AllianzGI is proactively
  hiring more product specialists with alternatives knowledge.

  **Structure and resources**

  The Alternatives division has its own operations team of around eight
  people, which is being built out under **Alexandru Nascutzy**, Global
  Head of Alternatives Operations, who reports into the global operations
  function. There are regional COOs for Asia, Europe and the US but no
  asset class specific COOs. AllianzGI is generally structured to support
  traditional long-only asset classes, but we understand that the business
  is looking to bring the regional operations models closer together over
  time and also to ensure that there are more specialists within global
  functions to provide tailored support to alternatives investment teams.

  Investment strategies and the teams running them are split regionally.
  According to internal sources, the rationale for this structure is that
  investors in the UK, Europe and US have different requirements, owing to
  tax and legal implications. Also, some of the regional teams have joined
  AllianzGI through acquisitions or team lift-outs.

  Whilst product development, risk and compliance are global functions,
  local investment desks do have their own legal and tax professionals,
  specific to individual desks rather than being shared across the
  Alternatives business.

  **Systems and outsourcing**

  AllianzGI's main platform is Bloomberg Asset and Investment Manager. The
  loan management business uses Allvue Systems (previously Black
  Mountain[^13]) which is deemed to be the best available system for
  credit.

  AllianzGI is moving from Northern Trust to State Street as its global
  administrator and custodian, using a single provider to drive down
  costs. The firm has fully outsourced its middle and back office,
  although an internal source commented on the difficulty of outsourcing
  these functions for alternative investments that are hard to value and
  price.

  **Infrastructure Debt**

  The now-€13 billion Infrastructure Debt platform was established in July
  2012 when AllianzGI hired a team from Trifinium Advisors led by Deborah
  Zurkow. **Claus Fintzen**, who joined from Trifinium with Deborah and
  three other colleagues, replaced Deborah as CIO and Head of
  Infrastructure Debt in 2016 when she was promoted to Global Head of
  Alternatives.

  The team initially managed internal Allianz money, but has been running
  pooled sterling-denominated vehicles since 2014, and also manages large
  segregated accounts from third-party institutions. A recent development
  was the May 2019 first close for the Euro Core Infrastructure Debt Fund
  at €270 million.

  AllianzGI launched its Resilient Credit strategy in May 2017 and hired
  **Emmanuel Deblanc** from BNP Paribas to lead it. The medium-term
  secured lending strategy focuses on asset-intensive businesses that have
  similar credit characteristics to infrastructure debt, but are more
  suited to shorter investment horizons.

  AllianzGI announced a second hire in May 2017, adding **Benjamin
  Walter** to its core infrastructure debt team. He previously helped
  BlackRock to set up its Infrastructure Debt platform and raise
  investment capital.

  **Infrastructure equity**

  Having created an infrastructure debt platform in 2012, AllianzGI formed
  a six-member renewable energies and infrastructure equity team later the
  same year. **Armin Sandhoevel**, CEO of Allianz Climate Solutions, was
  appointed as CIO Infrastructure Equity in 2012; he brought **Martin
  Ewald** and **Roderick MacDonald** with him from Allianz Climate
  Solutions. Martin was Co-Head of Allianz Climate Solutions' investment
  team and now has a dual role as Head of Investment Strategy,
  Infrastructure Equity and Lead Portfolio Manager, Impact Investments -
  he is responsible for developing new investment vehicles.

  The team launched the Allianz Renewable Energy Fund (AREF 1) at the end
  of 2012; the €150 million fund was fully invested by the start of 2015
  in wind and solar projects in four European countries. Their second
  fund, AREF 2, opened in March 2016 and closed that November with around
  €350 million; it was fully invested by December 2018. In total, the
  Infrastructure Equity team managed c. €1.6 billion in renewable energy
  and energy infrastructure projects by the end of 2018.

  AllianzGI launched its first multi-asset private market impact fund in
  September 2019 and is seeking to raise up to €300 million. The Allianz
  Impact Investment Fund, managed by Martin Ewald, will invest in equity
  and debt opportunities across sectors such as energy efficiency,
  sustainable land use and agriculture.

  Separately, Allianz Capital Partners (ACP) has been investing in
  infrastructure equity on behalf of Allianz insurance companies for more
  than a decade. Its capabilities were opened up to third-party investors
  for the first time in March 2019 with the launch of the Allianz European
  Infrastructure Fund S.A. -- RAIF (AEIF). The target fund size is €500
  million. Future transactions will be funded by Allianz insurance
  companies, who will continue to invest at least 50% of the required
  capital, while the remaining share will be funded by the AEIF.

  ACP joined forces with AllianzGI in January 2018 and now operates as a
  discrete entity under the AllianzGI umbrella. ACP manages around €28
  billion of alternative equity assets on behalf of Allianz across private
  equity, infrastructure and renewables, including €10 billion in
  infrastructure equity.

  **Private credit**

  Private credit capabilities include secured loans, senior debt,
  subordinated debt and equity securities. Line management for the
  European private credit team has been shifted out of Fixed Income into
  Alternatives. We understand that this transition was well managed with
  some adept soft politics; the fact that it was a relatively small
  capability in terms of AUM made the move easier.

  In Asia, AllianzGI hired Singapore-based **Sumit Bhandari** in November
  2018 to build and lead an Asian private credit team. He was Lead
  Portfolio Manager for The Abraaj Group's Asian Private and Opportunistic
  Credit strategies, and brought his colleague **Weizhong Yun** with him.
  With Allianz as an initial investor, Sumit and Weizhong are pursuing a
  senior secured debt strategy and mezzanine financing strategy, targeting
  private companies.

  Another significant recent hire was **Adrian Grammerstorf**, who joined
  the Munich office in January 2019 from UniCredit. He has 15 years of
  experience in mid-market debt and is responsible for developing
  AllianzGI's investment activity across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
  AllianzGI described his appointment as a milestone in the expansion of
  its German mid-market debt capabilities, with further new hires
  expected. Adrian reports to **Damien Guichard**, Head of European
  Private Credit, and works alongside **Alexander Ball**.

  **M&A activity**

  The 2016/2017 acquisition of Sound Harbor Partners, a US private credit
  specialist led by **Michael Zupon** and **Dean Criares**, extended the
  private debt business and was Deborah's first deal since assuming
  leadership of the Alternatives division. AllianzGI is open to further
  deals, according to CFO **Giulio Terzariol.** He told the *Financial
  Times* in March 2019 that acquiring alternative investment managers can
  be extremely profitable, and that he was particularly interested in
  adding capabilities in Asia.

  **Culture**

  AllianzGI has a largely French and German workforce with an average age
  of 47, and the environment is very different to a typical alternatives
  investment manager, according to internal sources. This creates a
  cultural challenge for the senior people trying to build a cutting-edge
  alternatives business within the juggernaut of AllianzGI. Furthermore,
  the Alternatives division is beholden to the dynamics of the broader
  asset management business. For instance, there was a hiring freeze in
  the second half of 2018 as a result of the long-only side struggling,
  according to an internal source.

  []{#AvivaInvestors .anchor}**Aviva Investors**

  **Background**

  Aviva Investors announced in May 2018 that it was combining its real
  estate, infrastructure and debt capabilities under a real assets
  umbrella. **Mark Versey**, previously CIO for Global Investment
  Solutions, was promoted to CIO of the new entity Aviva Investors Real
  Assets (AIRA).

  At the same time, Aviva Investors sold its Real Estate Multi-Manager
  (REMM) arm to LaSalle, along with its interest in Encore+, a €1.7
  billion pan-European real estate fund that it had been co-managing with
  LaSalle. **Ed Casal**, then-CEO of Real Estate and a co-founder of
  Aviva's Global Indirect Real Estate business, joined LaSalle as part of
  this acquisition. **Euan Munro**, CEO of Aviva Investors, said the
  transaction enabled AIRA to focus on** **"being a direct operator in our
  chosen markets in Real Assets, which is a strategic priority for our
  business." 

  In the summer of 2018, following this sale and restructure activity,
  AIRA stood at £37 billion AUM. This comprised £17 billion of direct real
  estate and £20 billion of alternative income solutions (including £8.1
  billion in real estate debt, £5.5 billion in infrastructure debt, £2.8
  billion in structured finance, £2.2 billion in private corporate debt
  and £1 billion in infrastructure equity). The business employs 300
  professionals across fund management, asset management, asset
  origination, underwriting, research and business management.

  Mark Versey told *IPE Real Assets* that AIRA's creation reflected an
  evolution in how institutional investors approach private markets: "Our
  clients are increasingly thinking about all the private markets
  holistically together, looking for diversification and yield
  opportunities that diversify away from the traditional markets of
  equities and bonds."

  Aviva Investors had been using the term real assets internally for some
  time and "is now being more explicit," Mark added. The firm was already
  managing real assets strategies for UK pension funds as part of its
  Return Enhancing and Liability Matching (REaLM) series, which includes
  funds investing in social housing, ground rents, infrastructure,
  commercial real estate and student accommodation. Furthermore, Aviva
  Investors launched an Alternative Income Solutions (AIS) fund in
  February 2017 ̶ a multi-asset alternative credit portfolio investing in
  real estate finance, infrastructure debt, private corporate debt and
  structured finance. 

  **Restructuring**

  AIRA's launch was followed in June 2018 by a broader reorganization of
  Aviva Investors into five pillars: equity, credit, multi-asset & macro,
  solutions, and real assets. A CIO was appointed at the helm of each
  division and a new leadership team was formed comprising the five CIOs
  plus CEO Euan Munro.

  -   **Al Denholm** was hired as CIO, Solutions; he was previously CEO of
      Prudential Portfolio Management Group

  -   **David Cumming** joined at the start of 2018 as CIO Equities; he
      was Standard Life Investments' Head of Equities

  -   **Colin Purdie**, **Peter Fitzgerald** and Mark Versey were promoted
      to CIOs of Credit, Multi-Asset & Macro, and Real Assets,
      respectively.

  The fixed income department was abolished. Global rates and emerging
  market debt were moved into the multi-asset & macro division, creating a
  more flexible approach to liquid assets that mirrors cohesion on the
  private markets side. "The traditional, siloed-model of managing money
  simply will not provide the flexibility or responsiveness to build
  solutions that meet clients' future needs," Aviva Investors announced.
  "We are making changes to the structure of our investment platform to
  improve processes and idea generation across teams and, ultimately, help
  us deliver better investment performance and outcomes for clients."

  By September 2019, AIRA had grown to £45 billion AUM, with significant
  external client wins during the first half of the year; however, they
  also lost a contract to manage a pan-European commercial property fund.

  height="5.875in"}**Real Assets: organisational structure**

  **Real Assets -- key operational changes**

  When the real assets platform was launched, the leadership team under
  Mark Versey comprised:

  -   **Barry Fowler**, Managing Director of Alternative Income

  -   **Daniel (Danny) McHugh**, Managing Director of Real Estate
      Investments

  -   **David Skinner**, Managing Director of Real Estate Strategy and
      Fund Management

  -   **Chris Urwin**, Director of Research for Real Assets

  David Skinner has recently left the firm. He was overseeing fund
  management, research, strategy and portfolio analysis for real estate.
  The long lease / long income real estate investment team has moved into
  Barry Fowler's world (Alternative Income) - according to an internal
  source, this reporting change was driven by Aviva's efforts to link
  together areas that have synergies for investors.

  David's remaining teams now report into Danny McHugh, who additionally
  leads asset management, development and new business for real estate.

  According to sources within AIRA, day-to-day operations at individual
  fund level have not changed significantly. Nonetheless, the
  restructuring has resulted in a range of positive outcomes:

  -   Management is now coordinated across real assets (although
      investment committees have not been combined at desk level)

  -   The whole of the real assets business is now physically located on
      one floor, which enables colleagues to work more closely together
      and encourages people to share market intelligence and ideas; better
      communication between desks allows different teams to avoid conflict
      (e.g. real estate debt and real estate equity teams not getting
      involved in the same assets)

  -   Research resources have been pooled into a central team covering
      real estate equity and debt, with more input from the investment
      teams

  -   There is more fluid movement of personnel - for instance, one
      professional moved from infrastructure into the real estate
      transactions team (transaction teams for real estate and
      infrastructure are still separate)

  -   Distribution is more joined up, with investment/product specialists
      now a shared resource reporting to **Mark Meiklejon** (Head of Real
      Asset Global Investment Specialists)

  -   AIRA is doing more work around co-mingled asset class products,
      which has been facilitated by the business being more cohesive

  One contact noted that there has not been a significant cultural shift,
  but this may be because investment desks at Aviva Investors have grown
  organically (rather than through acquisition).

  **Client Portfolio Solutions -- distribution, product and solutions**

  Mark Meiklejon joined the business in August 2018 from Aberdeen Standard
  Investments as Head of Real Asset Global Investment Specialists. Mark
  reports to **Steven Blackie**, Global Head of Product Strategy, who sits
  under **Louise Kay**, Global Head of Client Solutions. Louise manages
  teams of sales professionals who specialise by client type, as well as
  the consultant and client relationship management teams. She is
  ex-Standard Life Investors and reports to **Susan Ebenston**, President
  and Chief Operating Officer.

  Mark is part of the AIRA senior leadership team. He manages a team of
  asset class-focused Investment Specialists, who collaborate with
  generalist sales colleagues[^14], product teams and the investment
  desks, and act as a proxy for fund managers in front of clients.

  **Dr.** **Ljiljana MacDonald**, Global Head of Real Estate Investment
  Specialists, reports to Mark. (She previously worked on the Real Estate
  Multi-Manager capability and flagship European fund and strategy. She
  now focuses on the Income strategy in the UK and an equivalent small
  fund in Europe.) Given that the internal Aviva group clients are
  currently a priority for the Solutions team, experienced specialists
  like Ljiljana are getting involved in some broader multi-asset
  propositions, designing and structuring bespoke solutions, working
  across various teams in the business.

  AIRA's client base is predominantly comprised of institutional investors
  in the UK and Europe (especially France and Germany), although the firm
  has been trying to expand its footprint into North America, Asia Pacific
  and the Middle East. We note, however, that retention of distribution
  staff has been a challenge, with a number of international hires to the
  Client Portfolio Solutions team leaving after relatively short stints.
  These include:

  -   **Alex Knapp**: joined in 2016 as an Investment Specialist in the US
      covering alternative fixed income strategies. He left after almost
      two years and is now a Portfolio Strategist at Thomas J. Herzfeld
      Advisors.

  -   **Michael Benjamin**: hired in 2016 as a Senior Client Solutions
      Director to proactively develop new relationships with institutional
      investors and consultants in the US. He left after a year and moved
      to Franklin Templeton Investments.

  -   **Thijs Hupkes**: joined in 2017 from CBRE Global as Director of
      Real Estate Client Solutions for Asia Pacific and the Middle East, a
      newly created role based in Singapore. At the end of 2018 he moved
      to logistics real estate investment platform ESR.

  -   The firm also lost its Head of US (Institutional) Sales, **Timothy
      Jenkins**, to Ashmore in 2017.

  **Shared services resources and systems**

  AIRA has its own dedicated teams in fund accounting, compliance, tax,
  product and legal. These areas have a functional reporting line and
  therefore do not report into Mark Versey. For legal, one team supports
  investment transactions and another small legal team focuses on all the
  funds plus joint ventures. AIRA also outsources a lot of legal
  transaction work.

  Mark Versey counts a few non-investment staff among his reports,
  including **Arnaud Canonne**, Director of Change, Real Assets. Arnaud
  joined Aviva Investors in 2015 and is responsible for delivering
  significant change initiatives across AIRA, including upgrading the
  firm's core real assets systems, the design of a global operating model,
  and M&A activities.

  The different units within Real Assets use a number of separate systems;
  for instance, the real estate team uses Yardi for data management. IT is
  a cross business function sitting under the COO; however, Real Assets
  houses some technologists, including **Tania Green**, who joined at the
  start of 2019 as Yardi System Owner. She reports to **Toni Miller**,
  Real Assets Business Management Director, who is another of Mark
  Versey's direct reports and has responsibility for origination,
  structuring and execution of new infrastructure debt transactions.

  **Alternative Income**

  The Alternative Income platform is AIRA's largest component, with over
  £27 billion AUM across infrastructure equity and debt, real estate
  finance, real estate long income, structured finance and private
  corporate debt. These six asset classes share several characteristics:
  they are income-producing, unlisted, private assets that offer
  illiquidity or complexity premia over comparable listed credit. The
  platform offers a range of pooled funds and bespoke multi-asset
  solutions for insurance companies and pension schemes.

  Alternative Income houses c.100 professionals and is led by Barry
  Fowler, who joined the firm in 2014. His key lieutenants are as follows:

  -   **Infrastructure Debt**[^15]

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Darryl Murphy**, Head of Infrastructure Debt, leads a 24-person
      team managing an £8 billion portfolio of committed capital across
      Europe and Canada (£5 billion of this is invested in UK
      infrastructure).

  -   Sarah Wall, who joined the business in 2017 from the Pension
      Protection Fund (PPF), was a Senior Portfolio Manager in Alternative
      Income with responsibility for the portfolio management of
      alternative income funds and segregated mandates. She had a
      particular focus on infrastructure investments and reported directly
      into Barry Fowler, rather than into Darryl Murphy. We understand
      that she has recently left the business.

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Infrastructure Equity**

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Ian Berry**, Head of Infrastructure Equity, has five direct
      reports and 15 indirect reports. He joined Aviva Investors in 2009
      to lead a specialist team concentrating on unleveraged transactions.
      The infrastructure equity business focuses around the creation of
      'pseudo-fixed income' assets in niche, low- and medium-risk sectors
      of economic and social infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals
      and green technologies.

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Real Estate Finance**[^16]

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Gregor Bamert** is Head of Real Estate Finance and leads a team of
      originators sourcing relationships and transactions across the UK.
      Aviva Investors claims to be a leading provider of long-dated, fixed
      rate commercial real estate mortgages, with an end-to-end loan
      origination and management platform and a loan book worth c. £7.8
      billon (as of 30.09.18).

  -   Aviva Investors' real estate debt lending activities focused on the
      UK until 2015, when it hired AXA's **Romain Linot** to expand its
      platform into Continental Europe. A new mandate from Aviva France
      provided the capability to invest in euros. Romain, who is based in
      Paris, continues to manage the Euro Commercial Real Estate Debt fund
      for Aviva France. (Sources are a little unclear as to whether Romain
      reports to Gregor or John Dewey, Deputy CEO of Aviva Investors
      France, but the likelihood is that he has a line into both.)

  -   **James Tarry** is an experienced portfolio manager who runs the
      original Real Estate Debt fund, but also has a much broader role
      managing multi-asset alternative income funds with three direct
      reports. He reports directly to Barry Fowler.

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Real Estate Long Income** **(RELI)**[^17]

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Renos Booth**'s RELI team of c.12 fund managers and assistant fund
      managers has now moved to sit under Barry Fowler, having previously
      been in the Real Estate Investments unit reporting to David Skinner.
      According to an internal source, the long income strategies are
      now c. £5 billion AUM in size and, whilst the main investors to date
      are UK pension funds, they are replicating their core strategies in
      Europe.

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Structured Finance**

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Munawer Shafi**, Head of Structured Finance, joined Aviva
      Investors in 2010. His team of former bankers carry out bespoke
      deals across an array of markets, including mortgage-backed
      securities, collateralised debt obligations, social housing,
      leveraged finance, government-/supranational-guaranteed loans,
      aviation and trade financing. As of 30.09.18, they had completed
      over £3 billion of structured finance transactions.

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Private Corporate Debt**

  > Based in both London and Paris, the Private Corporate Debt team has a
  > track record going back to 2006 and manages c. £4 billion (as of
  > 30.09.18) across private placements and private corporate debt to
  > mid-sized and SME borrowers not yet able to tap the broader capital
  > markets.

  -   **Mathieu Gonin** joined in July 2019 from BNP Paribas as Head of
      Euro Private Corporate Debt. He reports to **John Dewey**, Deputy
      CEO of Aviva Investors France, but also has a dotted line into
      Munawer Shafi, who has functional responsibility for the Private
      Corporate Debt business. Mathieu replaced **Antoine Maspétiol**, who
      had been instrumental in developing the private European debt
      platform; Antoine moved to Parisian boutique Eiffel Investment
      Group, together with colleagues **Marie Bursaux** and **André
      Gonçalves.**

  **Real Estate Investments**

  Danny McHugh leads the Real Estate Investments business with a team of
  over 100 professionals in London, Paris and Frankfurt, managing £20.4
  billion (as at 31.12.18). The team used to be split between him and
  David Skinner, with Danny heading up asset management, development and
  new business, and David responsible for fund management, research,
  strategy and portfolio analysis. David recently left the business, so
  Danny now oversees the entire real estate function, including global
  REITs under **Francois de Bruin** and UK balanced funds under **David
  Diemer.**

  A key report of Danny's is **Melanie Collett**, Head of Real Estate
  Asset Management, who joined the firm around the same time as him. She
  is responsible for the sector-focused asset management teams,
  development management and project management capabilities. She has
  about 30 people under her, including the Portfolio Analysis and
  Valuation & Performance Analysis teams that formerly reported to David
  Skinner. Melanie has over 20 years' experience in real estate debt and
  equity; prior to joining Aviva, she was Head of Asset Management at
  Round Hill Capital, managing the European portfolio on behalf of US
  private equity partners.

  In September 2019, the firm hired **Edward Vaughan Dixon** from Landsec
  into the newly-created position of Head of ESG and Real Assets. Ed
  reports to Melanie and is responsible for the company-wide ESG real
  asset investment, development and asset management strategy.

  Other recent hires into the Real Estate business include **James
  Stevens**, Head of Development - Global Real Estate, who joined at the
  start of 2019 from Aberdeen Standard Investments. James reports to Danny
  and has responsibility for identifying and delivering mixed-use
  developments, joint ventures, land master planning and reconfigurations
  of schemes across the retail, leisure, commercial and residential
  sectors.

  In January 2019, AIRA appointed **Adrien Beuriot** to the newly-created
  role of Head of Continental Europe Asset Management for its property
  investment business. He is based in Paris and leads teams both in Paris
  and Frankfurt. Adrien joined from BNP Paribas Real Estate Investment
  Management, where he was Head of Investments, France.

  Aviva Investors Real Estate France is a separate entity from AIRA. It
  technically reports into Aviva Investors France at the moment, although
  we understand from an internal source that this is changing as the
  business moves towards a more functional global mode. Danny McHugh has
  oversight responsibility for Aviva Investors Real Estate France, even
  though the team does not yet formally report to him.

  []{#AXAInvestmentManagersRealAssets .anchor}**AXA Investment Managers -
  Real Assets**

  **Background**

  AXA IM - Real Assets is the largest real assets manager in Europe and
  the fifth biggest globally, as well as being the largest property
  portfolio and asset manager in Europe by AUM[^18]. It has €85 billion
  under management, including €64.3 billion in direct property and
  infrastructure and €16.9 billion in real asset finance (as of 30.06.19),
  overseen by 600 employees across 13 offices.

  AXA Real Estate Investment Managers was established in 1999 to manage
  AXA's real estate investments. It operated as AXA Real Estate until
  September 2015, when it was rebranded as AXA Investment Managers - Real
  Assets (AXA IM - Real Assets) to reflect a broadening out of its
  capabilities across the real assets spectrum.

  AXA IM - Real Assets has been active in the infrastructure debt sector
  since 2013, when it received a €10 billion infrastructure mandate from
  the AXA group. The platform was extended at the end of 2016 through the
  launch of a co-mingled infrastructure debt fund for third-party
  investors. AXA IM - Real Assets currently manages €6.4 billion in
  infrastructure debt (on behalf of third party clients as well as the AXA
  Group, as at 31.03.19) and is the fourth largest infrastructure debt
  manager worldwide[^19].

  The firm subsequently established an infrastructure equity capability,
  initially managing internal capital. In 2018 it completed its first
  direct infrastructure investment in the UK, with the acquisition of a
  15% stake in Agility Trains West.

  AXA IM - Real Assets describes its offering as "a 360° approach"
  comprising equity and/or debt, as well as private or listed instruments.
  **Isabelle Scemama**, who was promoted to CEO in February 2017
  (replacing **Pierre Vaquier**, who left the business), has been
  instrumental in developing the 360° approach.

  **Structure**

  When Isabelle was named CEO of AXA IM - Real Assets, a new Management
  Board was put in place, comprising:

  -   **Laurent Lavergne**, then Head of Separate Accounts, who was handed
      additional responsibility for international development in the US
      and Asia

  -   **Timothé Rauly**, who was appointed Head of Funds Group in February
      2017 (he was previously Head of CRE Finance & Core Funds)

  -   **Andrew Stainer**, who was promoted to Global Head of Asset
      Management, from Head of Northern Region, Asset Management &
      Transactions

  -   **Ruulke Bagijn**, Global Head of Real Assets Private Equity (who
      moved to AlpInvest Partners later that year as Head of Primary
      Investments)

  -   **Dennis Lopez**, then-CIO and Global Head of Sales (who left AXA in
      May 2017 to become CEO of QuadReal Property Group in Vancouver,
      which manages British Columbia Investment Management Corporation's
      real estate portfolio)

  -   **Sébastien Herzog**, Global CFO, COO & Corporate Secretary (who
      joined BlackRock in September 2019 as COO for France, Belgium and
      Luxembourg)

  The current management board is the same as the list above, minus
  Ruulke, Dennis and Sébastien, and with the additions of:

  -   **Florence Dard**, Global Head of Business Development, Real Assets
      since 2018

  -   **John O'Driscoll**, European Head of Transactions since the end of
      2017

  -   [**Olivier
      Thoral**](https://realassets.axa-im.com/web/realassets/biography-olivier-thoral),
      Global CFO, COO and Corporate Secretary since early 2019

  height="6.092361111111111in"}

  **Change at the top**

  **Andrea Rossi** decided in October 2019 to step down from his role as
  CEO of AXA IM after six years in post. Deputy CEO & Group CFO **Gérald
  Harlin**, who had been planning to retire in January 2020, has postponed
  his retirement date to become Acting CEO. He will also become Executive
  Chairman in December, replacing **Christof Kutscher** at the helm of AXA
  IM's board of directors. Andrea will serve as a strategic adviser to
  Gérald.

  **Governance**

  AXA IM - Real Assets now has a single governance structure, with one
  investment committee operating across all regions, the management board
  above, and an executive committee. Before the 'noughties', leadership
  was localized and not aligned, which led to different approaches and
  inconsistencies for investors (according to an internal source). Since
  then, AXA IM - Real Assets has developed a more harmonised and common
  culture, according to an internal source. Real Assets now has a Global
  Leadership Group, comprised of representatives from all the firm's
  functions, business lines and countries. The group is an information
  exchange and discussion forum for senior managers to share information,
  review recent and upcoming developments, and collaborate on transversal
  initiatives. Senior management has also endeavoured to ensure that the
  firm's leadership is not just comprised of French people based in Paris
  ̶ for instance, Andrew Stainer and John O'Driscoll are based in London
  and Laurent Jacquemin is in Tokyo.

  **Resources**

  Real Assets has historically operated separately from the rest of AXA
  IM. The overarching direction of travel is for Real Assets to be brought
  closer into the AXA IM family, according to a senior executive, but from
  a practical perspective Real Assets still functions autonomously.

  Given its size and scale, AXA IM - Real Assets has been able to build
  out its own dedicated resources across most business functions. It has
  its own product, marketing, business development, accounting, legal and
  compliance teams, and its own systems. Legal and compliance
  professionals focus 100% of their time on real assets, although they are
  able to work in conjunction with colleagues in the wider AXA IM family
  as and when additional expertise is needed. For compliance, about 80% of
  the work is done within Real Assets and 20% as part of the broader AXA
  IM ecosystem.

  HR is a shared resource across AXA IM. Relationships with regulators are
  also handled at the AXA IM level. Real Assets investment professionals
  can access skills and knowledge from the wider AXA group, such as an
  in-depth understanding of risks around businesses.

  Furthermore, having recourse to seed capital from the AXA parent has
  been a key competitive advantage for the Real Assets business,
  especially when it comes to testing out new strategies prior to launch.

  **Distribution**

  In early 2018, AXA IM - Real Assets created a Business Development
  department by bringing together its Client Capital Group, Research &
  Strategy, Marketing & Communication and Product Development teams.
  Florence Dard was brought over from AXA IM as Global Head of Business
  Development in March 2018 and joined the Management Board, reporting
  into Isabelle Scemama. Florence is based in Paris and was previously
  Head of France within AXA IM's Client Group, a role that involved
  capital raising for real estate and infrastructure equity and debt
  funds.

  The Client Capital Group within the Business Development department is
  co-led by **Stéphanie Rousset**, Head of Client Capital Group Europe,
  and **Stephan Ackermann**, Head of Client Capital Group US, Asia & DACH,
  who are both based in London. This team of distribution professionals
  are sufficiently experienced and sophisticated to sell across the
  various real asset strategies and seem to have a good reputation with
  investment professionals in the business. Members of the Client Capital
  Group liaise with distribution colleagues in AXA IM, and may also attend
  meetings together.

  **Benjamin Komarnicki** leads the Product Development function under
  Florence and is based in Paris. He is responsible for creating new
  products, monitoring the current range of strategies globally, providing
  market intelligence, and overseeing relationships with third-party
  managers. He took on his current role in January 2018, having formerly
  been Head of Corporate Finance, Real Assets.

  **Growth and expansion**

  A key facet to AXA IM - Real Assets' expansion has involved focusing on
  areas where the AXA parent already has a strong insurance business and a
  trusted brand. In Asia, they have been very active in Japan, where AXA
  Life Japan has a strong brand and invests in AXA IM - Real Assets' real
  estate equity and debt capabilities. Conversely, Real Assets has not
  moved into China, as AXA does not have an insurance business there, just
  local partnerships, and consequently their brand is not deemed strong
  enough.

  AXA IM - Real Assets has made also acquisitions to grow its presence in
  international markets. In November 2018, it agreed to acquire \$9.4
  billion of US commercial real estate loan mandates and a 24-strong US
  real estate debt team from Quadrant Real Estate Advisors. This
  transaction elevated AXA IM - Real Assets' real estate debt platform
  from a European to a global plane, bringing its loan portfolio to \$20.5
  billion and its total debt platform including infrastructure finance to
  c. \$28 billion.

  The 2016 acquisition of Eureka Funds Management in Sydney gave AXA IM -
  Real Assets an "immediate and significant footprint"[^20] in Australia
  and provided a gateway to the Asia Pacific region. Eureka had A\$5
  billion (€3.4 billion) of AUM at the time, including office and retail
  properties, real estate debt capabilities, and an alternative platform
  investing in car parks and hotels.

  **Transactions and capital raising**

  AXA IM - Real Assets has found fundraising and access to capital
  relatively straightforward, given its size and investors' increasing
  preference to gravitate towards the largest funds and firms. It raised
  €7.2 billion of new capital in 2018, including from 26 new third-party
  clients. The flagship Core European Fund continued to grow with a total
  of €1.7 billion in commitments at year-end.

  AXA IM - Real Assets completed €15.2 billion of global equity and debt
  transactions on behalf of clients during 2018. Direct property and
  infrastructure volumes reached €9.2 billion, comprising €5.2 billion of
  acquisitions and €4 billion of disposals. Debt-related investments stood
  at €6 billion. Acquisitions in alternative asset classes (an area of
  strategic focus for the business) accounted for 40% of overall 2018
  investment activity. The firm focused on sectors supported by
  demographic growth trends, such as logistics, hotel and healthcare real
  estate. In the digital infrastructure space, AXA IM - Real Assets
  acquired DATA4, a European data centre portfolio and operating platform,
  on behalf of its clients.

  In January 2019, AXA IM - Real Assets announced that it had raised €643
  million for its second Pan-European Value-Added Venture*,* PEVAV II
  (exceeding the initial target of €500 million). The fund aims to deploy
  up to c. €1.3 billion into well-located value-add investment
  opportunities in Europe's major cities. Over 60% of the equity raised
  was from follow-on investors from PEVAV, which closed in May 2016 having
  raised €445 million. Furthermore, €240 million of equity was raised from
  five new institutional clients from Europe, Israel and South Korea.
  **Ian Chappell** is Head of Value Add and Development Funds.

  **Recent appointments**

  -   **Stuart Carr-Jones** was named Head of UK, Ireland and Emerging
      Europe Transactions in June 2019, reporting to **John O'Driscoll**,
      Head of European Transactions. Stuart is responsible for the
      origination and execution of investment opportunities, and he also
      manages relationships with key intermediaries and partners to
      maximise deal flow opportunities. Stuart was previously a Senior
      Acquisition Officer in J.P. Morgan Asset Management's European Real
      Estate Group.

  []{#BlackRock .anchor}**BlackRock**

  **Background**

  BlackRock combined its real estate and infrastructure teams in 2016 to
  create a new real assets business under infrastructure chief **James
  "Jim" Barry**. BlackRock Real Assets had over \$50 billion in equity and
  debt assets and client commitments as at 31.12.18, overseen by 400
  employees in 27 offices. Bar real estate, the business has grown largely
  through acquisition. It is therefore, for the most part, an inorganic
  business with a set of autonomous investment units under the real assets
  umbrella that sit on the BlackRock platform and have access to the
  shared resources across the firm including operations, legal and
  marketing. In this format, units are relatively easy to acquire and to
  bolt on. This model has clear benefits including scale and flexibility.
  An additional advantage is that some asset owners investing in real
  assets prefer the focus of a boutique, which the BlackRock model also
  allows.

  Real Assets sits within BlackRock Alternative Investors (BAI), which
  manages over \$175 billion in total assets and client commitments across
  both private markets and liquid alternatives such as hedge funds. The
  illiquid part of the alternatives business enjoyed a record fundraising
  year in 2018 with \$16 billion. BAI houses more than 900 staff.

  In April 2019, BlackRock elevated the status of BAI to that of a
  specialist business, akin to Aladdin and to ETF and Index Investments.
  BlackRock runs each of these areas "as a global business that integrates
  a specialised sales force with manufacturing," according to a memo from
  CEO **Larry Fink**. "This will help ensure that all three continue to be
  engines of growth for the firm."

  **Edwin Conway** was promoted to Global Head of BAI, replacing **David
  Blumer**, who moved to an advisory role alongside his position as
  Chairman of Blackrock Switzerland. Jim Barry was appointed CIO of BAI,
  reporting to Edwin, and retains his role as Head of Real Assets. **Mark
  Wiseman**, Global Head of Active Equities, continues as BAI's Chairman.

  Edwin Conway has a distribution background, having previously served as
  Global Head of BlackRock\'s Institutional Client Business. He has strong
  credentials in alternatives, having joined BlackRock in 2011 from The
  Blackstone Group, where he led investor relations and business
  development. He currently has a remit to bring investment and
  distribution within BAI into closer alignment and is responsible for
  extending and commercialising BAI's investment capabilities. He is also
  a member of BlackRock's Global Executive Committee.

  The restructuring involved several other personnel changes, with about
  20 directors moving into different roles, and the BlackRock Alternatives
  Specialists team shifting from Distribution into BAI.

  According to an internal source, BlackRock has been trying for six or
  seven years to bring its alternatives teams more closely together under
  one umbrella, and the latest restructuring reflects ongoing efforts to
  attract and retain clients, ensure consistency for clients, and deliver
  performance. As a result of this multi-year evolution, the investment
  teams within BAI are now more closely aligned, especially around
  developing products and solutions for clients. Within BAI there is also
  an Alternatives Solutions team working across all the capabilities to
  design and construct portfolios of alternative investments for clients.

  The BAI umbrella structure also enables BlackRock to develop junior
  staff by rotating them through different investment desks, which helps
  retain and motivate people, and build more rounded experience.

  **\
  **

  **Distribution**

  The core client teams at BlackRock are product generalists who are
  aligned to client channels, own relationships and sell across asset
  classes. BlackRock has additionally had a dedicated alternatives
  distribution team for several years. It was called the BlackRock
  Alternative Sales Unit until 2015 when it became BlackRock Alternative
  Specialists (BAS). BAS used to report into Distribution but was moved
  into BAI in 2019 (as previously mentioned). The BAS team coordinates the
  sales and marketing of BlackRock's alternative investment products and
  capabilities, working in partnership with BlackRock\'s investment and
  client teams.

  The senior leadership for BAS includes:

  -   **Peter Nielsen**, Managing Director, Global Head of BlackRock
      Alternative Specialists. Peter used to be Head of the European
      Institutional Client Business and he reports to Edwin Conway.

  -   **Ingo Heinen**, Head of BlackRock Alternatives Specialists for
      EMEA, is based in London. Ingo joined from RBS in 2011, initially
      reporting to **Rick Arney**[^22], then-Head of Hedge Funds and Head
      of Alternatives Distribution, but subsequently reporting directly to
      Edwin Conway.

  -   **James Mellors** is Head of BAS for Asia Pacific, reporting to Ingo

  -   **Roque Calleja** was appointed Head of BAS for Latin America in
      March 2019, responsible for strategy and fundraising.

  The BAS team have sales targets and are responsible for capital raising
  and relationship management, but additionally get involved in product
  development and fund launches. Many of the team have the capacity to
  sell across different strategies, but have their individual specialisms.
  For example, **Alex Orr** is Head of Alternatives Distribution for the
  UK with a specialism in hedge funds and **Gregory Benhamou** is a
  Director and private markets specialist with a focus on real estate and
  infrastructure.

  Certain members of BAS focus on specific strategies and are very
  embedded in their investment teams. This is certainly the case for real
  estate which has a number of dedicated resources, and also Private
  Credit. For example **Jean Christophe Rey** is Head of Private Credit
  for EMEA within BAS, responsible for client relations and fundraising.
  He reports to Ingo but sits very much in the credit business and was
  hired into that business as a specialist strategist.

  There are one or two exceptions in terms of the reporting lines,
  including **Michelle Dunne**, Head of Global Consultant Relations, EMEA
  - Alternatives. She is responsible for developing relationships with
  alternatives contacts within global consultancies and specialist firms,
  and she reports into the Global Consultant Relations team. Until 2018,
  Michelle was a Director for Alternative Investment Sales (private equity
  and infrastructure).

  Separately, BlackRock is building a Client Services hub in Budapest for
  BAI to coordinate and administer a range of client service activities
  and reporting functions.

  **Support services**

  When BlackRock acquires a business, the usual protocol is to take out
  any core functions and reallocate resources to BlackRock's central teams
  (e.g. operations, finance and legal), leaving only the highly specialist
  resources plus the investment teams in the individual boutiques. As a
  result, reporting lines at BlackRock follow a matrix structure, so
  specialist staff in certain functions have a functional reporting line
  (e.g. to product development or operations), as well as often a dotted
  line into senior management within the alternatives division.

  BAI has its own small COO function, which is led in Europe by **Steve
  McGoohan**, EMEA COO for BAI. He functionally reports to BAI Global COO
  **Todd Slattery**, who reports to Jim Barry, but Steve also has a dotted
  line to **Tarek Mahmoud**, Managing Director, BAI, EMEA.

  Steve has a broad remit supporting the BAI umbrella. For example, he
  worked on bringing in a mid-market lending team to boost BlackRock's
  alternative credit capabilities. He has oversight of product development
  and structuring, and owns relationships with non-investment staff (e.g.
  legal specialists) in the boutiques. Steve and his team have also led
  projects around BlackRock's relevance for clients in Europe, looking at
  regulatory requirements.

  Some of the investment teams within BAI have their own COO and dedicated
  legal and tax staff. Steve assumes a more hands-on business manager role
  for smaller investment teams that are not of a sufficient size and
  maturity to merit their own dedicated COO.

  Steve manages a lot of resources through the matrix structure referred
  to above, but also has a couple of his own dedicated reports, working
  for him on cross platform projects that impact all the investment teams
  (e.g. Brexit, MiFID II implementation, efficiencies, etc.)

  **Real assets**

  Under Jim Barry, senior leaders for Real Assets include:

  -   **Anne Valentine Andrews**, Deputy Head of Real Assets

  -   **Alan Synnott**, Global Head of Research & Product Strategy for
      BlackRock Real Assets

  **[Real Estate]{.ul}**

  **Marcus Sperber**, Global Head of Real Estate, left the business
  earlier in 2019. We understand that he was not directly replaced and
  that all the real estate desk heads now report up to Jim Barry.

  **Justin Brown** is Head of European Portfolio Management and Chairman
  of the European Real Estate Equity Investment Committee. He is
  responsible for all the European-based core funds and he chairs
  the European Real Estate Equity Investment Committee.

  In Asia Pacific, **John Saunders** leads the real estate business.
  **Greg Lapham**, Head of Investments for Asia Pacific Real Estate,
  resigned in August 2019. His responsibilities were taken on by **Hamish
  MacDonald**, BlackRock's Head of Real Estate in Australia, who now leads
  BlackRock's APAC investment teams and oversees the origination,
  evaluation and execution of investments. John, Greg and Hamish all
  joined BlackRock when it acquired their former firm, MGPA, in 2013.
  Another MGPA veteran, **Connie Peng**, was promoted to Head of BlackRock
  Real Estate for China in 2018.

  **[Real assets debt]{.ul}**

  BlackRock created a real assets debt group in March 2019 by combining
  its \$10.5 billion infrastructure debt capabilities with real estate
  debt to form a single \$11 billion platform.

  **Erik Savi**, who had been running infrastructure debt, left to become
  Global Head of Carlyle Infrastructure Credit in New York. Instead of
  replacing Erik, BlackRock combined his team with **Robert Karnes**' real
  estate debt unit, placing Robert at the helm of the new platform. The
  plan to pool these capabilities had been in the works anyway, according
  to a memo from Jim Barry, but Erik's departure accelerated the move. At
  the same time, **Jeetu Balchandani** was promoted to Head of Americas
  and APAC Infrastructure Debt.

  Other recent appointments include **Guillaume Vandewalle**, who joined
  from ING in September 2018 as a VP in the European infra debt team, and
  **Rupert Gill**, who joined in September 2017 from Hatfield Philips as a
  Portfolio Manager and Head of the European Real Estate Debt team.

  **[Infrastructure]{.ul}**

  Jim Barry founded BlackRock's infrastructure business in 2011 upon
  joining the firm; he was previously CEO of NTR plc. The Infrastructure
  Investment Group focused on equity initially, then subsequently moved
  into infra debt in Europe and North America. It offers infrastructure
  funds as well as funds-of-funds, and has raised one of the largest
  global renewable power funds.

  As Head of Real Assets, Jim continues to oversee the infrastructure
  business and is supported by Anne Valentine Andrews, Deputy Head of Real
  Assets. Anne was Co-Head and COO of Morgan Stanley's infrastructure
  platform prior to joining BlackRock in 2014.

  Jim also led the Renewables group until January 2019 when **David
  Giordano** was promoted to Global HHHhHead of Renewable Power. David
  previously oversaw renewable energy infrastructure in the Americas and
  Asia Pacific, and was replaced by **Martin Torres** in the Americas and
  by **Charlie Reid** in Asia Pacific (Charlie relocated from London to
  Sydney). **Rory O'Connor**, Head of Europe, was given the additional
  role of Global CIO for the renewables group.

  In 2017, BlackRock acquired the First Reserve Energy Infrastructure
  Funds (FREIF), the \$3.7 billion equity infrastructure franchise of
  private equity firm First Reserve. The team of 37 investment
  professionals and support staff is led by **Mark Florian**, Head of
  Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Funds, who joined BlackRock when
  the deal closed.

  **Alternatives**

  **[Private equity]{.ul}**

  BlackRock Private Equity Partners (PEP) is the private equity investment
  solutions group at BlackRock. PEP has offices in Princeton, Zurich,
  London and Hong Kong, and manages more than \$29 billion across a range
  of commingled funds and separate accounts (as at 31.12.18). PEP invests
  globally across the range of private equity strategies, including
  venture capital, growth, buyouts, distressed, and special situations.
  BlackRock has been investing in private equity** **since 1999 across
  primary funds, secondaries, and direct co-investment opportunities.

  **Russell Steenberg** founded PEP in 1999 when he joined Merrill Lynch
  Investment Managers (which merged with BlackRock in 2006) and currently
  serves as its Global Head. Russell is a member of BlackRock's Global
  Operating Committee, BAI Executive Committee, Alternative Strategies
  Executive Committee, as well as the PEP Executive Investment Committee
  and PEP Internal Investment Committee.

  **[Long Term Private Capital]{.ul}**

  **André Bourbonnais** joined BlackRock in June 2018 as Global Head of
  Long Term Private Capital (LTPC). He was previously CEO and CIO of PSP
  Investments, the \$110 billion Montreal-based Canadian public pension
  fund, where he presided over a rebuild of the firm's private market
  capabilities. André's team includes [**Dag Skattum**, EMEA Head of Long
  Term Private
  Capital,](https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-gb/biographies/dag-skattum)
  Managing Directors **Colm Lanigan** and **Erik Levy**, and Directors
  **Philipp Haid** and **John Overbay**.

  On 1 April 2019, BlackRock announced it had raised \$2.75 billion in
  commitments for its LTPC fund, including \$1.25 billion in hand and an
  additional \$1.5 billion committed to be available as the strategy
  scales up. The LTPC fund, which will take long-term positions in private
  companies, was built in collaboration with cornerstone institutional
  investors.

  **[Private credit]{.ul}**

  BlackRock offers a broad spectrum of private credit strategies, from
  opportunistic and distressed debt, to middle market investing, and
  specialty finance. **James Keenan** is CIO and Global Co-Head of Credit
  within BAI. He leads the strategy for Global Fundamental Credit and
  oversees Leveraged Finance, Hedge Funds, and Private Credit businesses.

  Fellow Co-Head of Credit **Tim O'Hara** is responsible for determining
  the strategic direction and growth initiatives of the Global Credit
  platform. He is accountable for business management, product strategy,
  business development and alternative credit sourcing.

  Other senior leaders include:

  -   **Stephan Caron**, Head of European Middle Market Private Debt

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Steve Sterling**, Head of BlackRock U.S. Private Capital

  ```{=html}
  <!-- -->
  ```
  -   **Justin Ferrier**, Managing Director of the Asian Private Credit
      platform

  In 2018, BlackRock acquired Tennenbaum Capital Partners (TCP Capital), a
  Los Angeles boutique specializing in middle market performing credit and
  special situation credit opportunities, with some \$9 billion in
  committed capital. TCP Capital is led by Howard Levkowitz, Managing
  Partner, Chairman and CEO, alongside four other partners: **Lee
  Landrum**, **Michael Leitner**, **Philip Tseng** and **Rajneesh Vig**.

  **Alternative Solutions Group**

  The Alternative Solutions Group (ASG) is a 25-strong team that
  constructs and manages multi-alternative portfolios, using the
  investment capabilities across BAI as building blocks. The team thinks
  of itself as similar to Blackstone's Tactical Opportunities function.

  **Pam Chan**, CIO and Global Co-Head of ASG, was one of the group's
  co-founders in 2013 (a year after she joined BlackRock). Prior to
  becoming CIO, she served as a senior portfolio manager and primary
  deputy to the former CIO. Pam is currently responsible for leading the
  investment management of Alternative Solutions portfolios and for
  chairing the Alternative Solutions Investment Committee. She is also a
  member of the BAI Executive Committee. She replaced **Nugi
  Jakobishvili**, who was CIO / Head of Alternative Solutions until he
  left to join multifamily office Iconiq at the start of 2019.

  The ASG sits within BAI with Pam reporting to Edwin. **Louay Mikdashi**,
  Head of Alternative Solutions EMEA, reports to Pam and is London-based.
  Louay joined the firm in 2015 from Santander Asset Management where he
  had been Chief Investment Strategist. He has about 6 people in his
  London based team.

  understand that Michelle is familiar with the key people there. We would
  be glad to conduct reference checks and perform further research if
  required.*

  []{#MacquarieInfrastructureandRealAssets .anchor}**Macquarie
  Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA)**

  **Background**

  Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) has a 25-year track
  record and a team of over 800 people who currently manage approximately
  US\$129 billion of assets; this includes 155 portfolio businesses, 600
  properties and 4.7 million hectares of farmland. It is the world's
  largest infrastructure manager and has even been dubbed "the vampire
  kangaroo", likening the Australian firm to Goldman Sachs for its
  omnipresence.

  Until 2018, Macquarie's public and private markets businesses were
  firmly divided and run as separate firms, with their own investment,
  distribution, marketing, product and back office functions.

  MIRA was brought into Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) in 2018 when
  **Martin Stanley**, Global Head of MIRA, was promoted to Group Head of
  MAM. He continues to lead MIRA and to chair the Boards and Investment
  Committees of MIRA's largest funds. Martin replaced **Shemara
  Wikramanayake** at the helm of MAM; she was promoted to CEO, replacing
  **Nicholas Moore**.

  MAM now has two businesses, MIRA and Macquarie Investment Management
  (MIM). Macquarie Group acquired Philadelphia-based Delaware Investments
  in 2009, which rebranded as Macquarie Investment Management in 2017. MIM
  offers fixed income, currencies, equities, hedge funds and multi-asset
  solutions.

  At the end of 2018, Macquarie announced that a number of teams were to
  be reorganised between operating groups. This included the following:

  -   The Macquarie Specialised Investment Solutions (MSIS) business,
      which moved out of MAM and into Corporate and Asset Finance (CAF) in
      the Bank Group

  -   MSIS' fiduciary businesses, including infrastructure debt (MIDIS),
      remained within MAM

  -   Macquarie Capital's global real estate principal investment and
      private capital markets capabilities moved into MAM and merged with
      MIRA Real Estate, building out the real estate platform to AUD26.8
      billion AUM (US\$19.5 billion).

  According to press announcements at the time, these changes were made
  "to better align businesses with a shared focus on particular customer
  segments or geographies."

  MAM now has AUD552.7 billion of AUM (US\$387.6 billion as at 30.06.19),
  roughly 24% of the Macquarie Group's total business. Despite MIRA only
  contributing a third of MAM's AUM, Macquarie is arguably better known
  for its private markets capabilities.

  With the former Head of MAM now CEO of the Macquarie Group, MAM is
  starting to attract more attention and is focusing on growth. Martin
  Stanley is looking to bring MIRA and MIM closer together, with greater
  collaboration across all non-investment functions. This is the opposite
  direction of travel to many of the other firms we have researched.

  **MIRA**

  MIRA was born out of Macquarie's infrastructure expertise and has
  broadened its capabilities through acquisitions. It initially managed
  balance sheet capital from the Macquarie bank, but over time opened up
  to third-party clients, and now claims to partner with more than 650
  pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies worldwide.

  MIRA now manages and invests across four asset classes, including real
  estate, renewables and agriculture, but infrastructure is by far the
  largest sector. In June 2019 MIRA announced the close of its sixth
  European infrastructure fund with €6 billion committed, concluding a
  record period for MIRA with total global fundraising reaching
  approximately €13 billion[^23].

  [\[CHART\]\[CHART\]]{.chart}The business currently breaks down roughly
  as follows[^24]:

  **Structure**

  Martin Stanley, now Group Head of MAM, is based in London. Under him,
  MIRA's senior leadership is split by region or asset class.

  -   **Leigh Harrison** is Head of MIRA EMEA and is based in London; he
      was previously MIRA's COO

  -   **David Fass** was appointed Head of MIRA Americas in April 2019; he
      was previously CEO of Macquarie Group's operations in EMEA

  -   **Ben Way** in Hong Kong and **Frank Kwok** in Sydney are Co-Heads
      of Asia Pacific

  -   **Elizabeth O'Leary** is Head of Agriculture, based in Sydney

  -   **Brett Robson** is Head of Real Estate, based in Sydney

  Other key people in London include:

  -   **Philip Hogan**, Senior Managing Director, has responsibility for
      MIRA's European funds' portfolio management and transaction
      execution activities. He joined MIRA in 2005 from EY.

  -   **James Dyckhoff**, Global COO, has a focus on global strategy and
      other strategic initiatives including M&A activity.

  -   **Arthur Rakowski**, Senior Managing Director, is one of the
      original founders of MIRA. He is Chairman of the Investor Solutions
      Group and oversees major client account management, as well as
      building relationships with large sovereign, insurance and pension
      funds. He also continues to supervise MIRA's efforts in the Middle
      East and their European infrastructure funds. Prior to joining
      Macquarie Group in 1992, Arthur spent six years at KPMG in Sydney.

  Of the four core investment divisions within MIRA, Infrastructure Funds
  is the main business with about 700 people managing US\$111 billion AUM
  in c.42 funds[^25] that are run on a regional model. Roughly half of the
  business is in Europe; each region has a head, of which there are eight
  globally including Europe. Beneath the regional heads are four or five
  Senior Managing Directors or Senior Partners; this includes **Jiri
  Zrust**, who leads country coverage for MIRA in Europe, as well as
  managing a portfolio of energy, transport and telecom infrastructure
  investments.

  MIRA Europe Ltd.'s (MIRAEL) funds are governed as follows:

  -   An** Investment Committee** comprised of MIRA employees and senior
      advisors makes recommendations regarding investment decisions for
      the funds

  -   The funds are managed day-to-day by MIRA staff, including industry
      specialists; they are supported by sector-based teams, e.g.
      airports, toll roads and communications

  -   An **Advisory Panel** counsels MIRAEL on strategic and commercial
      issues, as well as helping to identify investment opportunities and
      facilitate the investment process

  -   An **Investors\' Prudential Review Committee**, comprised of some of
      the funds' major investors, provides a sounding board

  -   MIRAEL's directors are Martin Stanley, Arthur Rakowski, James
      Dyckhoff, Leigh Harrison and Philip Hogan

  For the non-investment parts of the business, MIRA has a matrix
  structure. Resources such as operations, legal, finance, marketing,
  reporting and risk management are in a common pool and are shared across
  the business. The four investment divisions within MIRA collaborate in
  certain areas such as origination.

  **Investor Solutions**

  **Phil Peters**, Global Head of Investor Solutions, runs one of the
  verticals in MIRA and reports directly to Mark Stanley. Phil leads a
  60-strong global Investor Solutions Group, which handles new business
  initiatives, product development, fund formation, capital raising and
  client relations globally. The central distribution team raises capital
  from investors for all MIRA's products and asset types.

  Historically, MIRA was largely regionally focused for distribution and
  not globally coordinated. For example, one team would sell just European
  infrastructure to a global investor base. Phil was hired in October 2017
  to drive better integration and globalise distribution for private
  markets, implanting a model with local market specialists who could sell
  across asset classes.

  **Steve Gross**, Head of the Asia Pacific Investor Solutions Group,
  leads the development of new real assets platforms and institutional
  relationships for MIRA's new businesses in Asia and Australia. He is
  also a member of MIRA's Global Management Team. **Adam Lygoe** is the
  lead for new business in EMEA and Phil Peters for the Americas.

  MIRA has recently lost **Paul Murphy**, who was a senior member of the
  Investor Solutions Group responsible for developing relationships with
  European institutional investors, with a primary focus on real estate
  and infrastructure. He left the firm in October 2019 and has just joined
  Barings as Head of Product, European Real Estate.

  To date, the client-facing teams at MIRA have worked fairly
  independently from their colleagues in MIM, who have a regional and
  client channel specialism. For example, **Gillian Evans**, Head of UK
  Institutional, mainly develops business with DC and DB pension fund
  clients in the UK. The MIM teams tend to have broader solutions-based
  conversations with clients, meaning that whilst Gillian sits in MIM and
  has mainly sold equities over the last couple of years, she has also had
  some success selling private credit and private infrastructure debt.

  MIRA's investor relations teams have historically approached clients in
  a less holistic manner, just speaking to the relevant person at the
  asset owner for the specific product they were fundraising for at the
  time.

  Internal sources expect MIRA to move to one central distribution team,
  most likely led by Phil Peters as Global Head of Distribution for MAM.
  One MIRA source said they are expecting a big announcement imminently.
  Senior sales staff will continue to specialise, but there will be an
  overlay relationship manager, who can understand clients' longer term
  needs and cross sell, bringing in specialists where relevant.

  []{#Schroders2 .anchor}**Schroders**

  **Background**

  Schroders began to form its Private Assets division in 2016 and formally
  announced its launch in 2017. **Philip Mallinckrodt** served as Group
  Head of Private Assets and Wealth Management until March 2017 (he is now
  a Non-Executive Director). Schroders then promoted **Alan Cauberghs** to
  Head of Private Assets in July 2017 (he was previously an Investment
  Director in the global fixed income unit). Alan's mandate was to bring
  together Schroders' capabilities in real estate, infrastructure
  financing, private debt and private equity. However, although many of
  the individual unit heads reported into Alan, we understand that they
  were "given lots of rope" and that business units were run fairly
  independently, with little cross sharing of resources and intelligence.

  In February 2019, Schroders appointed **Georg Wunderlin** as Global Head
  of Private Assets, replacing Alan who was made redundant. (Alan has
  recently joined Generali Investments as Head of Private Assets.) Georg
  reports directly into Group Chief Executive **Peter Harrison** and sits
  on the Group Management Committee. He is a private assets specialist
  with 20 years of experience, having been CEO of alternatives firm HQ
  Capital since 2016[^26].

  Schroders' Private Assets and Alternatives businesses had £39.3 billion
  in AUM as at 31.08.19, which amounts to 9% of Schroders' total AUM
  according to their 2019 half year results. This breaks down as shown in
  figure 1[^27].

  [\[CHART\]]{.chart}

  In its most recent trading update, Schroders said it is focusing on
  building its Private Assets and Alternatives capabilities, which are of
  strategic importance to the group. Nonetheless, one internal source
  described Schroders' core private assets business as "homemade" and very
  traditional. The example given was the real estate team, which
  originally ran money for balanced funds (i.e. lower returning
  investments) and still has little in the way of opportunistic, higher
  risk strategies.

  Another source said that Schroders' distribution network and product
  capabilities have "failed them" and they haven\'t raised significant net
  new assets, especially for Direct Lending. According to the source, this
  was because they didn't get the "plumbing" and talent in place for
  structuring new products prior to making acquisitions, nor did they
  spend the requisite time and investment on distribution.

  **Restructuring**

  Schroders has been restructuring its Private Assets and Alternatives
  businesses over the past year, which has included the appointment of
  Georg Wunderlin in February. This effort is ongoing and sources with
  whom we have spoken anticipate further developments over the coming
  months, with the unit becoming more collaborative internally.

  We anticipate that Georg will broaden out his management team by hiring
  external talent, which he has already started to do. However, a key
  cultural challenge for him will involve bringing specialists from
  historically disparate boutiques into central resource pools; this may
  take some time.

  We also understand that some of the alternatives business heads still
  report separately. For example, **Michelle Russell-Dowe**, Head of
  Securitized Credit, reports into **Karl Dasher**[^28], CEO - North
  America & Co-Head of Fixed Income, even though data from her unit is
  reported as part of the Real Assets business.

  **Shared services and systems**

  Historically, the various strategies that now make up Private Assets
  have operated as independent boutiques, with certain units such as Adveq
  having dedicated resources for operations, finance, compliance, risk,
  IT, product and distribution.

  Schroders recently hired Morgan Stanley's **Richard Bennett** into the
  newly-created role of Chief Operating Officer, Private Assets,
  Investment Management[^29]. We understand that Richard is currently
  working with **Lance DeLuca**, Head of Investment Operations, and
  **Peter Hilborne**, Chief Operating Officer -- Operations, to work out
  which parts of the investment, operations and product processes are
  unique to Private Assets. Richard's appointment is part of an initiative
  by Schroders to ring-fence Private Assets and Alternatives off from the
  rest of the business to become more of a stand-alone unit with a
  separate operating model and resources. We anticipate there to be a
  number of changes to resources and reporting lines once Richard is
  settled into the business.

  Systems integration will be a significant challenge, according to our
  sources. Most units use separate legacy systems that require specialist
  staff, are incompatible with each other, and are not integrated with the
  core platform (Aladdin). For example, the real estate business is on a
  system called Yardi, whereas Adveq uses eFront (although the acquisition
  of eFront by BlackRock may resolve this problem). **Robert Jopson** has
  just been promoted to Global Head of Private Assets Technology (he was
  previously Head of Investment Operations Technology) and is likely to be
  leading the development of this business from a systems integration
  perspective.

  **Distribution**

  The Alternative Sales Unit (ASU) was set up in 2018[^30] to sell Private
  Assets strategies and has been led by **Peter Arnold** since he joined
  the business in June 2019. Specialist sales staff who previously
  reported into the heads of their particular units should now
  theoretically sit within the ASU under Peter and sell across the
  different private assets strategies. However, there has been some
  internal push back from unit heads who had grown accustomed to having
  their own dedicated resources, which has resulted in some fluidity of
  reporting lines.

  Peter himself has a dual reporting line into Georg Wunderlin and **John
  Troiano**, Schroders' Global Head of Distribution (due to retire at the
  end of 2019, to be replaced by **Lieven Debruyne** who currently leads
  the Asia Pacific business). Prior to joining Schroders, Peter was Global
  Head of International Fund Distribution at Citi, focusing on private
  debt, real estate and global infrastructure. He was responsible for the
  origination and distribution of third-party private assets products to
  institutional investors globally.

  Schroders is looking to increase ASU's resources and hired credit
  specialist **Nicholas Pont** earlier in 2019 from Alcentra as a
  Director, based in London. However, a couple of our sources believe that
  remuneration for individuals within ASU is below that of alternatives
  sales roles in specialist investment firms or investment banks, which
  may prove a challenge as the team seeks to grow further.

  A significant proportion of the Private Assets business is managed by
  Schroders Switzerland, which makes Switzerland a significant hub within
  the group - several of the Alternatives Directors (specialist sales) are
  based in Zurich.

  Aside from Schroder Real Estate Investment Management, which has
  historically had some success with a few large Asian investors, and the
  Securitised Credit team in the US, Schroders has experienced limited
  success selling outside of Europe.

  **Product and solutions**

  Product development and strategy was previously led by **Charles
  Hopkinson-Woolley**, who was made redundant at the end of 2018 and is
  now Global Head of Product Development - Private Markets at Invesco.
  Charles ran the Schroder Global Alternative Investor Access (GAIA) range
  of liquid hedge fund strategies and was responsible for developing the
  broader Alternatives and Private Assets business from a product strategy
  and design perspective. He had a team of five manager selection and five
  product executives reporting to him and worked closely with his
  colleagues on the core product team led by **Mike Champion**. He also
  collaborated with **Alexandra (Alex) Peters** **Nerbrand**, Head of
  Product Development, Private Assets - she moved from the core product
  development team into the Private Assets unit when it was launched,
  reporting into Alan Cauberghs.

  The Private Assets division is looking to shore up its central product
  development and management capabilities. However, component parts such
  as real estate, which has enjoyed its own dedicated product specialist
  resources (including **Tom Dorey**, Head of Real Estate Product in
  London), are keen to hold onto them rather than move to a pooled
  structure.

  Schroders has also diversified its solutions business by bringing in two
  private assets specialists, both reporting into **Neil Walton**, Head of
  Investment Solutions. **Ji-Eun Kim** joined in January 2019 as Head of
  Private Asset Manager Solutions; she has a background in private equity
  and was most recently a Director at i3 Kapital. **Chaipetch "Ped"
  Phrompechrut** joined in 2018 as a Solutions Manager; Ped was Head of
  Private Market Solutions at Willis Towers Watson.

  **Real Assets investment teams**

  **Schroder Real Estate Investment Management (SREIM)**

  The Schroder Real Estate business was established in 1971 and now has 15
  teams across Europe, Asia and the US, encompassing over 150 people. The
  business has grown both organically and by acquisition and investment,
  most recently with the purchase of Blue Asset Management earlier in
  2019. This added a further €1.2 billion in assets under management, a
  new location in Munich and a greater presence and expertise in the
  German, Swiss and Austrian real estate markets. Blue Asset Management's
  three founding managing directors and 17 employees joined Schroder Real
  Estate.

  Other recent additions to the business include taking on the management
  of a listed REIT focused on ground rents, the establishment of a
  Manchester office focussing on residential properties, and the
  acquisition of pan-European hotels specialist Algonquin in May 2018.
  Algonquin had €1.8 billion in AUM at the time of the purchase, and the
  deal involved Schroders securing various co-investments alongside
  Algonquin's existing clients.

  Schroders now has £16.2 billion real estate AUM (as of 30.06.19) and an
  investment range that allows clients globally to access real estate
  through open-ended funds, listed REITs, specialist funds, joint
  ventures, separate accounts and global real estate securities.

  **Duncan Owen** is Global Head of Real Estate and Chairman of the
  company's investment committee, reporting into Georg Wunderlin. Duncan
  joined Schroders in 2012 and took over leadership of the property
  business in 2013 when he succeeded **William Hill**.

  Duncan's direct reports include **Nick Montgomery**, Head of UK
  Investment and **Robin Hubbards**, Head of Real Estate Capital. Robin
  joined the firm in 2018 from InfraRed Capital Partners, a global
  investment manager focused on infrastructure and real estate; he is
  responsible for managing the capital raising, new product development
  and investor relations activities of Schroder Real Estate globally. His
  team includes Tom Dorey, Head of Property Product and **Philipp
  Ellebracht**, Head of Real Estate Product Continental Europe.

  There have been a number of other recent people moves within the team:

  -   In September 2019, SREIM appointed **Jonathan Harris** as the new
      Head of Continental Europe, based in London. He has also joined the
      SREIM investment committee and reports to Duncan Owen. Jonathan
      joined from Macquarie Group, where he led teams advising on and
      investing in European and Asia Pacific real estate across a wide
      range of sectors and strategies, via both private and public capital
      markets.

  -   **Laurent Dubos** was promoted to Head of France at SREIM in
      September. He is focusing on new investments and on maximizing
      performance across the various funds and client portfolios in
      France, Belgium and Luxembourg. He has taken over from **Thomas
      Guyot**, who joined the firm in 2013 and launched the Paris-based
      platform. Thomas was also a significant player in the acquisition of
      Algonquin.

  -   **Raphaël Berdot** joined the now six-strong Paris team in March
      2019 as an Investment Manager. He reports to Laurent and previously
      worked in asset management at AEW Ciloger.

  **Schroder Adveq - private equity**

  In 2017 Schroders acquired Zurich-based private equity manager Adveq,
  which was then rebranded as Schroder Adveq Management AG. Adveq's CEO
  **Sven Liden** left after the takeover (he is now COO of Montana Capital
  Partners), as did Adveq's Head of UK **Farah Buckley** (now Head of
  Investment Solutions at Hermes GPE).

  Schroders hired **Reto Schwager**, Robeco's Head of Private Equity, to
  replace Sven as CEO in January 2018 but Reto left the business after
  less than a year in post. Following Reto's exit, his responsibilities
  were taken on by the existing Schroder Adveq management team. **Rainer
  Ender**, who had been part of the team since 2001, was promoted to Head
  of Private Equity; other key members of the team include **Tim Creed**,
  Head of Investments Europe, and CIO **Nils Rode**, who also leads the
  Schroder Adveq Labs data science activity.

  Schroder Adveq now has over 120 employees (up from 100 at the time of
  acquisition) across offices in Zurich, Frankfurt, London, Jersey, New
  York, Beijing and Hong Kong, including its own Chief Compliance Officer,
  CFO, COO, Head of Risk Management, Head of Product Management and
  General Counsel. The investment teams are mainly based in Zurich, New
  York and Beijing.

  Schroder Adveq has \$10 billion of private equity AUM (grown from \$8
  billion in 2017). It focuses on investment solutions that access select
  private equity segments through primary, secondary and direct or
  co-investments. The client base comprises mainly institutional investors
  located in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific.

  In July 2019, Schroders agreed to acquire a majority stake in
  Zurich-based BlueOrchard Finance, an impact investing and microfinance
  provider in emerging and frontier markets. The deal is expected to
  complete before year's end.

  BlueOrchard has \$3.5 billion assets under management and offers credit,
  private equity and sustainable infrastructure products, as well as
  blended finance mandates. This partnership is part of Schroders'
  expansion of its sustainability capabilities; it also accelerates the
  firm's growth in private debt and private equity investments in emerging
  markets. BlueOrchard's management team will remain in place; however,
  Peter Harrison, Georg Wunderlin and **Stephen Mills**, Chairman of
  Schroder Adveq, will all join the board to enable implementation of
  joint strategic decisions.

  **Securitised Credit**

  Schroders acquired Brookfield Investment Management's \$4 billion
  securitised products business in 2016. The Brookfield team (led by
  **Michelle Russell-Dowe**, Head of Securitized Credit) joined Schroders'
  New York-based fixed income group, doubling its AUM at the time. The
  business now has over \$11 billion AUM and a team of 15 dedicated
  investment professionals, supported by global macro and global credit
  resources (as at 30.06.19). To date, the Securitised Credit business has
  not technically been part of Private Assets, with Michelle reporting
  into **Karl Dasher**[^31], CEO North America & Co-Head of Fixed Income
  at Schroders. Both Michelle and Karl are based in New York.

  The investment team members have diverse industry backgrounds, including
  specialist portfolio managers in mortgage-based strategies, asset-based
  strategies and CRE Loans, and dedicated statisticians and developers.
  The team's focus is the data-intensive sector, in which Schroders
  believes it possesses a competitive advantage in analysing relative
  value opportunities. They offer a range of benchmarked, floating-rate or
  cash, opportunistic and direct real estate loan strategies. The team
  also manages a number of bespoke portfolios designed to meet a client's
  specific needs and/or regulatory requirements. They have pooled funds
  available to UK pension schemes in Enhanced Securitised Libor,
  Opportunistic Securitised and Loan strategies.

  Most investors are legacy US clients, although with the hire of Nicholas
  Pont this year from Alcentra, Schroders is hoping to develop the client
  base further in the UK and Europe.

  **GAIA (Global Alternative Investor Access) -- liquid alternatives**

  Over the past 20 years, Schroders has built one of the world's largest
  liquid alternatives fund ranges. They now offer internally-managed
  strategies alongside a selection of externally-managed, normally
  hard-to-access, liquid alternative products. These are offered in a
  liquid, transparent and regulated way through the GAIA platform.

  Charles Hopkinson-Woolley (who was Head of Alternative Product and Head
  of the Private Assets strategic capability) ran GAIA until his departure
  in December 2018, when **Andrew Dreaneen** was promoted to Head of
  Liquid Alternatives. He is responsible for all commercial aspects of the
  platform including manager selection, product development, product
  management, sales and marketing.

  In October 2019, Schroders announced the launch of a private equity fund
  focusing on small and medium-sized companies in Europe and the US. The
  Schroder GAIA II Specialist Private Equity fund will provide \"greater
  investment flexibility for a potentially larger pool of prospective
  clients\" by addressing the issues that have traditionally made
  accessing the asset class challenging. The fund offers monthly
  subscriptions and quarterly redemptions with a minimum investment of
  \$50,000; it will sit on the GAIA platform but is being managed by
  Schroder Adveq (the private equity team).

  **Schroder Secquaero**

  Secquaero Advisors has been an affiliate of Schroders since 2013, acting
  as its exclusive adviser for insurance-linked securities (ILS) since
  June of that year. The team has been active in the ILS sector since 2008
  and was behind the creation of the first ever transfer of catastrophe
  risk to the capital markets.

  In July 2019 Schroders increased its stake in Secquaero Advisors to 100%
  (up from the 50.1% it had held since February 2016). Secquaero is now
  fully integrated into the Schroders ILS business, which is based in
  Zurich and managed by **Dirk Lohmann** - this combined ILS team operates
  within Schroder Investment Management (Switzerland), trading under the
  name Schroder Secquaero. The Schroders ILS unit now manages circa \$3
  billion of reinsurance linked assets (as at 30.06.19) and is run by a
  team of 25 professionals.

  **Schroder Aida - infrastructure finance**

  Schroder Aida is a subsidiary of Schroders dedicated to infrastructure
  investments globally. Since forming in 2015, Schroder Aida has
  successfully raised and invested over €2.3 billion in senior debt,
  junior debt and in equity, focusing on core European infrastructure
  assets which are aimed at institutional investors in Europe and Asia.
  The team comprises 15 employees based in Paris and London and has
  completed 51 transactions, across 10 countries and 10 sub-sectors, with
  £1.5 billion raised and £1.3 billion invested (as at 30.06.19). We
  understand that the vast majority of Aida's client base are French
  investors.

  **Charles Dupont**, Head of Infrastructure Finance, established the
  business which has since been run as a boutique. Senior members of the
  team have worked together since 2013, initially at AXA Investment
  Managers and from 2015, at Schroders. In addition to investment
  professionals (including **Jérôme Neyroud**, Head of Investments,
  Infrastructure Debt), Aida has had a dedicated legal and compliance
  manager, Head of Risk, Head of Portfolio Operations and Infrastructure
  Finance Middle Office professional, all based in Paris. A couple of team
  members are based in London, including one analyst and Investment
  Director **Claire Smith**, who is responsible for fundraising and joined
  in 2017 from Macquarie.

  Total remuneration paid to Aida's 10 staff in 2018 amounted to €2.6
  million, of which €1.7 million was fixed remuneration and €0.9 million
  was variable remuneration[^32].

  **Direct lending**

  Schroders does not have a direct lending team; however, in 2016 it did
  acquire a 25% stake in a Dutch credit provider, Neos Direct Lending,
  which has 15 investment staff. Schroders increased this stake to 49% in
  2018, with the option of a further increase to 100% through a joint
  venture agreement, backed by KKR. We understand that this has not been a
  successful JV for Schroders, especially due to a lack of specialist
  distribution capabilities, and that they are looking to exit this
  partnership.

  **Potential talent for a succession plan**

  In our view, there is only one potential candidate -- **Duncan Owen** --
  suitable for a succession plan, given that the current Global Head of
  Private Assets, Georg Wunderlin, is relatively new into the business and
  the previous incumbent, Alan Cauberghs, has just started a new role
  himself. Other boutique heads have not had the breadth of exposure nor
  experience across different strategies, and their individual
  distribution footprints are relatively narrow.

  We have also provided a biography for **Boudewijn Jansen**, who we
  believe could be a useful hire for LGIM. He is not a natural successor
  to the global leader of LGIM's Real Assets unit, but offers a highly
  relevant skill set for a strategic COO/Business Manager type role, with
  many years of experience in alternatives specialist product structuring
  and investment development. Boudewijn's role was made redundant
  following the departure of his former boss, Alan Cauberghs. He is on
  gardening leave until the end of 2019 and is keen to find a strategic
  role helping another asset manager develop its alternatives business.
